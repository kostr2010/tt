     A bad old woman making a worse will,
       A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?
     A band of children, round a snow-white ram,
       A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes
       A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,
     A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream
     A beauty at the season's close grown hectic,
       A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,
     A bee flew out and stung her to the heart,
       A beggar and a queen,' or was (of late
     A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
     A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,
     A better welcome to the tempest-tost;
       Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made
     A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;
       A blessing is sound sleep—Juanna lay
       A book, friend, single lady, or a glass
       A borough is comprised along the height
     A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
       About a bow-string—quite in vain; not yet
       About; a circumstance which has confounded
       About a liquid glassful will remain;
       About his ears, and nathless would not bend:
     About his past or present situation.
       About his person, and Pedrillo's too,
       About philosophy, pursued his jaunt
     About the day—the era 's more obscure.
       About the lower region of the bowels;
     About the present family's deaths and wooings.
       About the present, past, or future state.
     About the prettiest ankle in the world.
     About the right divine how far we should
       About the time and place where he had been:
     About this time a beautiful white bird,
     About this time, as might have been anticipated,
       About what 's call'd success, or not succeeding:
     Above all, I beg all men to forbear
       Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,—
     Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;
     Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.
       Above the ice had like a skater glided:
       Above them their dessert grew on its vine,
       A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;
     Abroad, such things decide few women's fate—
     Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,
     A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,
     A bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,
     A bungler even in its disgusting trade,
       A busy character in the dull scene,
     A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,
       A canto—then their feet and ankles,—well,
       A case which to the juries we may leave,
       Accompanied with a convulsive splash,
       Accorded with her Moorish origin
       According as their minds or backs are bent.
     According as the skies their shadows threw.
     According as you take things well or ill;—
       According to all hints I could collect
       According to direction, then received
     According to some good old woman's tale.
     According to the ancient epic laws,
     According to the artillery's hits or misses,
     According to the best of dictionaries,
       Account for every thing which may look bad
       A certain portion of uncertain paper:
       A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder—
       A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain

     A charlatan, a coxcomb—and have been,
       A child of Chancery, that Star Chamber ward
     A child of Nature, carelessly array'd:
       A child the moment when it drains the breast,
     Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.
       Achilles' self was not more grim and gory
       A city which presents to the inspector
     Acknowledge aught of dread of death or foe:
       A comment on the Gospel's 'Sin no more,
     A corner for herself; and therefore fiction
     A country in all senses the most dear
       A couplet, or an elegy to claim,

       A courier to the prince, and he succeeded
     A cow's shape for a mask—was only (sinking
       Acquire the deep and bitter power to give
     A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,
     Acted upon the living as on wire,
     Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
     A cure for grief—for what can ever rankle
       (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,
     A daily plague, which in the aggregate
     'A dainty dish to set before the King'
     A dame who kept up discipline among
     Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,
       A dashing demoiselle of good estate,
     A day of gold from out an age of iron
     A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,
       Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,
       Added to his connection with the sea,
       Added to those his lady with such vigour
       Adding, that this was commonest and best,
     Addressing him in tones which seem'd to thank,
     Add what may be call'd marriage in disguise.
     Adeline and Don Juan rather blended
     Adeline, no deep judge of character,
     A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,
     A devotee when soars the Host in sight,
       A difference between crockery ware and plate,
     A difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'
     A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole
       Admired, adored; but also so correct,
     Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,
     Admiring this new native of the deep.
     Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorr'd)
       Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,
       Admitted as an aspirant to all
     Admitted a small party as night fell,—
     A door that's in or boudoir out of the way,
     A dreadful impulse to each loud meander
     A 'dreadful trade,' like his who 'gathers samphire,'
     A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,
       A drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd
     A drowsy frowzy poem, call'd the 'Excursion.'
       A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze
     A dull and family likeness through all ages,
       Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.
       Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:
       Advances with exasperated rap,
     Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,
     Adversity is the first path to truth:
     A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot
       A fact without some leaven of a lie.
     A fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd
     Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales
     A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.
       A favourite horse fallen lame just as he 's mounted,
     A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.
     A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed
       A female child of ten years tried to stoop
       A female family 's a serious matter
       A few brief questions; and the answers gave
     A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine
       A few words of condolence on his state:
     Affect no more than lightning a conductor.
     Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.
       A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,
       A figure fit to walk before a king;
       A fine extension of the faculties,
     A finish'd gentleman from top to toe.
     A fisherman he had been in his youth,
     A fisher, therefore, was he,—though of men,
       A floating balance of accomplishment
     A fond hallucination, and a theme
     A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.
       A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,
     A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.
     A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,
     A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;
     A frequent model; and if e'er she must
     Afric is all the sun's, and as her earth
     A friend to freedom and freeholders—yet
       A frown on Nature's or on human face;
       A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough—
       After a decent time must be gallanted;
     After all), or like Irish at a fair,
     After a sort; but somehow people never
       After due search, your faith to any question?
     After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,
       After long travelling by land or water,
     After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets
     After some fascinating hesitation,—
     After the first investigating view,
     After the good example of 'Green Erin,'
       After the hardships you 've already borne.
     After the manner then in fashion there;
     After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
       After the taking of the 'Cavalier,'
     After the usual process, might be found
       A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;
     A further proof we should not judge in haste;
       Again it opens, it can be no other,
       Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:
     Against all evil speaking, even in jest.
     Against all noble maladies he 's bold,
     Against all women of whate'er condition,
       Against her being mention'd as well fitted,
     Against his heart preferr'd their usual claims,
     Against proportion—the wild strokes of nature
       Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before
     Against the boundary it scarcely wet.
       Against the creed and morals of the land,
       Against the light wherein she dies: he clung
     Against the same given quantity of rhyme,
     Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot
     Again the weather threaten'd,—again blew
     Again through shadows of the night sublime,
       Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;
     Again—what is 't? The wind? No, no—this time
       A gale, and in the fore and after hold
     A garment of a mystical sublimity,
     A gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in
       A general council, in which unanimity,
       A general object of attention, made
       A genius who has drunk himself to death,
       A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,
     A gentlemanly distance, not too near,
     A gentleman so rich in the world's goods,
     A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,
       A glance around—and shrugg'd—and twitch'd his sleeve
       A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,
     A glance on that slain son, his first and last.
       A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,
     A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale—
     A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile
     A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,
     A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
     A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.
     A good deal practised here upon occasion.'
     A goodly guardian for his infant charge,
     A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made
     A goodly spirit for a state divan,
       A great opinion of her own good qualities;
     A great resource to all, and ne'er denied
     A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,
     A Greek had raised around this elevation
     A green field is a sight which makes him pardon
     Agree to a short armistice with truth.
     A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,
       A guardian green in years, a ward connected
     Ague in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,
     A gust—which all descriptive power transcends—
     A habit rather blamable, which is
        A half-starved babe, a wreck upon life's ocean,
       A half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space
       A half-way house of diplomatic rest,
     A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;
       A handsome man, that human miracle;
     A hazy widower turn'd of forty 's sure
       A heavy price must all pay who thus err,
       A hecatomb of suitors with devotion,
     A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.
     A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,
     A hidden nectar under a cold presence.
     Ah! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!
     Ah, if you had but follow'd my advice!'
     A higher title, or a loftier station,
     (A 'Highland welcome' all the wide world over).
     A hint, in tender cases, is enough;
     Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,
             Ah! no;—the voices of the dead
     Ah, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!
     A hospital, a church,—and leave behind
     Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!
     A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown
     A human Hydra, issuing from its fen
     A human (what the Italians nickname) 'mule',
       A hundred thousand men might fight again
       A husband like Alfonso at my side;
     A husband rather old, not much in unity
     Ah! what is man? what perils still environ
     Ah!—What should follow slips from my reflection;
     Ah! who can tell? Or rather, who can not
     Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,
       Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.
     Air 'midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces
       A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,
     A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!
     A jest at Vice by Virtue 's call'd a crime,
       A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
       A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:
     A junction of the General Meknop's men
       A jurymast or rudder, or could say
     A kerchief, crying, 'Give Sal that!'—and died.
       A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,
     A kind construction upon them and me:
     A kind of blunt compassion for the sad
       A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;
     A kind of death comes o'er us all alone,
     A kind of flattery that 's hardly fair
       A kind of phantasy proportionate
     A kind of pride that he should be among
       A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar:
     A kind of sleepy Venus seem'd Dudu,
       A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,
       A kind of triumph I 'll not recommend,
     A kingdom or confusion anywhere,
     A king in constitutional possession
           A king sate on the rocky brow
     A lad of sixteen causing a divorce
       A lady altogether to his mind.
       A lady always distant from the fact:
       A lady; Baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd
       A lady of a 'certain age,' which means
     A lady with apologies abounds;—
     A lady with her daughters or her nieces
     A lamp burn'd high, while he leant from a niche,
           A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine—
       A language, too, but like to that of birds,
     A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;
     Alas! by all experience, seldom yet
     Alas! could she but fully, truly, know
     Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were
     Alas! her star must fade like that of Dian:
       Alas! his country show'd no path to praise:
     Alas, how deeply painful is all payment!
     Alas! I must leave undescribed the gibier,
     Alas! man makes that great which makes him little:
     Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,
     'Alas, poor ghost!'—What unexpected woes
     'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing,
     Alas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!
     Alas! the love of women! it is known
     Alas! there is no instinct like the heart—
     Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,
     Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,
     Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
     Alas! what to their memory can lack?
     Alas! worlds fall—and woman, since she fell'd
     A laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.'
       Albeit all human history attests
       Albeit my years were less discreet than few;
     A lecture and some money: for four springs
     A legal broom 's a moral chimney-sweeper,
       'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'-
     A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,
     A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)
     Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,
     Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
     Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
       Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;
       Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,—
     Alfonso paused a minute—then begun
       Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,
       Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;
       Alfonso's days had not been in the land
       Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,
     Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,
     Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
       A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:
       A life which made them happy beyond measure.
     Alighting rarely:—were she but a hornet,
       A like gold bar above her instep roll'd
       Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce
     A line, and leave posterity undone,
       A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
       A little black upon this new flirtation;
     A little 'blase'—'t is not to be wonder'd
     A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,
       A little cupola, more neat than solemn,
     A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,
       A little earlier than the waning moon.
       A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy
       A little heavy, but no less divine:
       A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
       A little scorch'd at present with the blaze
       A little smuggling, and some piracy,
     A little spoil'd, but not so altogether;
     A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;
     A little still she strove, and much repented
     A little turn for mischief you might trace
     A lively reader's fancy does the rest.
     All are not moralists, like Southey, when
     All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?
     All bad propensities in fifteen hundred
     All bashfully to struggle into light.
       All by which hell is peopled, or as sad
       All Calderon and greater part of Lope,
       All cars, though long; all ages, though so short,
       All comedies are ended by a marriage;
       All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,
     All countries have their 'Lions,' but in the
     All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,
     All difficulties, whether great or small,
       All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on
       All European climes, by land or sea,
     All except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,
     All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,
     All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,
       All felt a soft kind of concatenation,
     All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.
     All generations, I should like to know
       All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,
     All heroes, who if living still would slay us.
       All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred
     All I can say is—that he had the money.
     All in all to each other: though their speech
     All it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,
     All kinds of toil, save for our country's good—
     All matchless creatures, and yet bent on matches.
       All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,
       All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams
     All nations have believed that from the dead
     All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,
       All one an hour hence.' Juan answer'd, 'No!
     All other magazines of art or science,
     All people, at all times, and in most places,
       All phantasies, not even excepting mine;
     All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,
     All, praised the empress's maternal love.
     All present life is but an interjection,
       All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;
       All private favourites of Don Juan;—for
     All propagated with the best intentions;
     All proper men of weapons, as e'er scoff'd high
       All purged and pious from their native clouds;
     All ragamuffins differing but in hue,
     All save the blacks seem'd jaded with vexation,
     All song and sentiment; whose hearts were set
     All sounds it pierceth 'Allah! Allah! Hu!'
       All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand
       All that a poet drags into detail
     All that defies the worst which pen expresses;
     All that I know is, that the facts I state
       All that it hath of life with us is living;
       All that the best can mingle and express
       All that the body perpetrates of bad;
       All that the devil would do if run stark mad;
     All that the mind would shrink from of excesses;
       All that the Russians did upon this day,
     All that we read, hear, dream, of man's distresses;
     All the ambassadors of all the powers
       All the attention possible, and seen
     All the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls
     All there was as he left it: still his taper
     All these are, certes, entertaining facts,
     All these are little preludes to possession,
     All these confirm my statement a good deal,
     All these, or any one of these, explain
     All these things will be specified in time,
     All these were theirs, for they were children still,
     All these were unobjectionable matches,
     All things pursue exactly the same route,
     All things that have been born were born to die,
     'All this is very fine, and may be true,'
     All this must be reserved for further song;
     All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,
     All this she told with some confusion and
       All this, the most were patient, and some bold,
     All this were very well, and can't be better;
     All those may leap who rather would be neuter
       All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw
     All tragedies are finish'd by a death,
     All tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,
       All trembling, wondering, without the least notion
       All very accurate, you must allow,
       All walls men know, and many never known;
     All was prepared—the fire, the sword, the men
     All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber
     All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
     All which selected from the spoil he gathers,
       All who have loved, or love, will still allow
     All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:
       All youth—but with an aspect beyond time;
     Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.
       Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend
     Almost as much as on a new despatch,
     A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.
     Alone can save the earth from hell's pollution.
       Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you
     A lonely pure affection unopposed:
     A long and snake-like life of dull decay
     Along his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel
     A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,
       Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,
       Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams
       Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)
       Along the leaguer'd wall and bristling bank
       Along the rest, contrived to keep this den
     Along the road, as if they went to bury
     Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted
     Aloud because his feelings were too tender
     A lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,
     A lovely female face of seventeen.
       A lovely statue we almost adore,
     A love of music and of scenes sublime,
     A lover as had cost her many a tear,
       A lover with caprices soft and dear,
     A loving languor, which is not repose.
       A loving letter with a mystic seal,
     A low soft ottoman), and black despair
     Already many a once love-beaten breast
     Already they beheld the silver showers
     Also a foreigner of high condition,
     Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,
     Also arose about the self-same time,
       Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;
     Also a so-so matron boldly fight

     Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,—
       Amidst such scenes—though this was quite a new one
       Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude
     Amidst the bodies lull'd in bloody rest.

       And elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;
     And 'entremets' to piddle with at hand,
     And epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;
     And 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos'
     And 'Europe's Liberator'—still enslaved.
     And even if by chance—and who can tell?
     And even if I knew, I should not tell—
       And even my Muse's worst reproof 's a smile;
     And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,
     And even that he had so rarely heard,
       And even the good with inward envy groan,
     And even the wisest, do the best they can,
     And even those were nearer than they knew.
       And ever-dying Gladiator's air,
       And everybody but his mother deem'd
     And every body out of their own sphere.
       And everybody wondering more or less,
       And every couch is occupied; you had best

       And every day help'd on his convalescence;
     And every difficulty being dispell'd,
     And every morn his colour freshlier came,
       And every new creation hath decreased
       And every now and then we read them through,
       And every sound of revelry expired;
     And evidences which regale all readers.
          And expell'd the friars, one friar still
       And fact is truth, the grand desideratum!
       And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit
     And false—though true; for surely they 're sincerest
       And families, even to the last relation;
       And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,
     And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,
       And far away, the last bud of her race,
     And far be it from my Muses to presume
       And 'farmers' can't raise Ceres from her fall:
     And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.
       And feeling, in a poet, is the source
       And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,
       And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
       And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,
     And fell all ravenously on their provision,
     And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
       And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,
       And felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;
     And felt—though done with life—he was alone
       And few there are whom these cannot estrange;
     And fight like fiends for pay or politics.
       And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;
     And find a deuced balance with the devil.
       And find a quincy very hard to treat;
       And fired it into one assailant's pudding—
     And firmer faith no ladye—love desire;
     And first a little crucifix he kiss'd,
     And first he wonder'd why he had refused;
     And first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,
     And first one universal shriek there rush'd,
     And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,
       And fits her loosely—like an easy glove,
       And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,
       And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
       And flew at all she met, as on her foes;
       And flew to her young mate like a young bird;
     And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,
       And follow far the disappearing sun,
       And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:
       And for his theme—he seldom sung below it,
     And form'd a basis of esteem, which ends
     And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,
       And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;
     And for the boat—the crew kept crowding in it.
     And for the effeminate villeggiatura—
       And for the fame you would engross below,
       And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
     And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.
     And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.
     And for their rights connubial make a stand,
       And for the moment it had some effect;
     And forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,
       And fortune, has an awkward part to play;
       And for which Nature might forego her debt—
       And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,
       And fought away with might and main, not knowing
       And founded Doctors' Commons:—I have conn'd
     And found him not amidst the various progenies
     And found much linen, lace, and several pair
       And found their lives were let at a short lease—
       And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number
     And fourscore cannon on the Danube's border
     And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,
     And fresh, and 'beautiful exceedingly,'
     And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.
     And frights, especially if 'tis a daughter,
     And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally
     And from its context thought she could divine
       And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,
     And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines
       And full of promise, as the spring of prime.
     And full of sentiments, sublime as billows
     And further downward, tall and towering still, is
     And further on a group of Grecian girls,
     And gain an inch of staircase at a time.
     And 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;
       And 'gainst those few your annalists have thunder'd;
       And gall'd the Russians with a heavy fire,
       And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,
       And gather'd as they run like growing water
       And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
     And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.
     And gazed around them to the left and right
     And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.
     And gaze where'er the palace or the hovel is,
     And gazing on the dead, she thought his face
       And General Fireface, famous in the field,
     And 'gentlemen' are in a piteous plight,
     And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,
     And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,
       And girt by formidable waves; but they
     And giving up all notions of resistance,
     And glides away, assured she never hurts ye.
     And glory long has made the sages smile;
       And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
       And God knows who besides in 'au' and 'ow,'
     And, going down head foremost—sunk, in short.
     And grace is said; the grace I should have sung—
     And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.
       And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;
       And Greek—the alphabet—I 'm nearly sure;
     And grieved for those who could return no more.
       And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
     And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,
     And grow quite figurative with their figures.
       And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then
     And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,
     And had it not been for some stray troops landing
     And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.
       And had retain'd his boyish look beyond
       And haggard with a dissipated life,
     And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,
     And Haidee clung around him; 'Juan, 't is—
     And Haidee met the morning face to face;
       And Haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook
     And half a million for your Sabine farm
       And half forgot their danger and despair:
     And half of that opinion 's also mine.
       And half retiring from the glowing arm,
     And hands obey—our hearts are still our own.'
       And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;
       And happiest they who horses can engage;
     And harder for the heart to overcome,
     And hardly heaven—because it never ends.
     And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,
     And harmonised by the old choral wall:
       And hastily—as nothing can confound
     And hate all vice except its reputation.
     And hate those who won't let them come to pass.
       And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,
       And have not yet attain'd to much success.
     And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);—
       And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
       And having casually glanced it through,
     And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,
     And having lived with people of all ranks,
       And, having o'er itself no further power,
       And having pick'd up several odds and ends
     And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,
     And 'Hayley's Triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,
       And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied
     And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,
       And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
     And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.
       And he arose, advanced. The shade retreated,
       And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
       And heartless daughters—worn and pale and poor,
     And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,
     And he begun a long low island song
     And he could even withstand that awkward test
            And he did not seem form'd of clay,
       And he himself obliged to shut up shop—he
       And he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;
     And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.
     And hell and purgatory—but forgot
            And he 'll say nought to you;
     And hell, there must at least be six or seven.
       And help them with a lie or two additional,
     And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,
       And hence arise the woes of sentiment,
       And henceforth found himself more gaily class'd
     And hence high life is oft a dreary void,
     And hence some heathenish philosophers
     And her brow clear'd, but not her troubled eye;
     And here and there some stern high patriot stood,
     And here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,
       And here exactly follows what he said:—
     'And here,' he cried, 'is Freedom's chosen station;
     And here he was—who upon woman's breast,
     And here I leave them at their preparation
     And here I must an anecdote relate,
     And here Juanna kindly interposed,
       And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:
     And here she summon'd Baba, and required
     And here the advantage is my own, I ween
       And here thou art a god indeed divine.'
       And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:
       And here we may remark with the historian,
     And her head droop'd as when the lily lies
     And heroes are but made for bards to sing,
     And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.
       And hers were those which can face calculation,
       And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,
     And her voice was the warble of a bird,
     And he stood gazing out on the cascade
     And he whose very body was all mind,
     And he who understands it would be able
     And hew out a huge monument of pathos,
     And hide her little palpitating breast
       And hid her face within Juanna's breast:
       And higher grew the mountains as they drew,
       And his black curls were dewy with the spray,
       And his disguise with due consideration
            And his mass of the days that are gone.
     And his one blow left little work for two.
     And hold up to the sun my little taper?
       And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
     And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,
       And honour'd, ran a risk of growing less so;
     And horrid was the contrast to the view—
     And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
     And how he had been toss'd, he scarce knew whither:
       And howl'd for help as wolves do for a meal—
     And how should the most fierce of all be firm?
     And how the deuce they ever could have birth;
       And how the goddesses came down to men:
     And how this heavy faintness pass'd away
     And how to parry the renew'd attack?
     And how to scale a fortress—or a nunnery.
     And how ye may be doubly widows—wives!
       And huge tombs worse—mankind, since Adam fell:
       And human lives are lavish'd everywhere,
     And hurls at once his venom and his strength.
     And I am with you.'—Whereon Johnson took
     And I assure you, that like virgin honey
       And I became a prisoner to the foe.'
       And I can give my whole soul up to mind;
     And Ida in the distance, still the same,

     And if his passions now and then outran
     And if I had to give a casting voice,
     And if I laugh at any mortal thing,
     And if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'
     And if in flattering strains I do not predicate,
     And if in the mean time her husband died,
     And if it is impossible, you shall:
     And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,
     And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,
       And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on
     And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
     And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
     And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
       And, if still free, that such or such a lover
     And if their approbation we experience,
     And if their full contents I do not give ye,
     And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
     And if they had, they could not have secured
     And if they should discover your disguise,
       And if this violent remedy be tried—
       And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring
     And if we can but till the morning keep
     And if we now and then a sigh must heave
     And if you are not satisfied with that,
       And if you had it o'er again—'t would pass—
     And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
       And I grown one of many 'wooden spoons'
     And I know nothing which could make amends
       And I love wisdom more than she loves me;
     And I must even survive this last adieu,
     And I must say, I ne'er could see the very

     And insolence no doubt is what they are
       And in such colours that they seem to live;

       And in the Danube's waters shone the same—
     And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood
     And in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,
     And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,
     And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
     And in their native beauty stood avenged:
       And in them crowded several of the crew;
     And in the midst a golden apple grew,—
       And in the worn and wild receptacles

       And is extinguish'd sooner than she ought:
     And I shall be delighted to learn who,
       And I shall place Juanna with Dudu,
     And I shall take a much more serious air
       And I should still have many things to say;'
     And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
     And is not much improved by growing old.'
     And is there not religion, and reform,
       And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?
       And, it might be from thought or toil or study,
     And I will war, at least in words (and—should

       And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard
     And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd
     And Juan gazed as one who is awoke
     And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,
     And Juan grew carnation with vexation,
     And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,
       And Juan now his willingness exprest
     And Juan, on retiring for the night,
     And Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust
     And Juan's mind was in the proper tone
       And Juan's suite, late scatter'd at a distance,
       And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,
       And Juan throttled him to get away,
       And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
       And Juan too, especially the latter.
       And Juan, too, in general behind none
       And Juan took his place, he knew not where,
     And Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,
       And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;
     And Juan was received, as hath been said,
     And Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,
       And Juan, who had still refused, because
       And Julia instant to the closet flew.
     And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
     And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
       And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;
     And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet
       And kept her heart serene within its zone.
       And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,
       And kings and consorts oft are mystified,
       And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when
     And knew no better in her immorality
     And knew such brightness was but the reflection
       And knew the self-loves of the different nations;
       And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,
     And know no more of what is here, than there;—
       And Konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,
       And Lady Marys blooming into girls,
     And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
     And largest, thinking it was just the thing
     And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,
       And lay before them with his children near,
       And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
       And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;
       And leaving land far out of sight, would skim

       And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:
       And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;
     And left his widow to her own aversion.
     And let few opportunities escape
     And let the Babel round run as it may,
     And levell'd weapons still against the glacis.

     And like some other things won't do to tell
     And likes particularly to produce
     And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:
     And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.
     And lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath.
       And listening to the topics most in vogue;
     And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,
     And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,

       And long besides.'—'Oh! if 't is really so,
     And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.
       And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,
       And long he paused to re-assure his eyes
       And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,
       And long the latest of arrivals halts,
     And look'd as much as if to say, 'I said it;'
       And look'd at Juan hard, but nothing utter'd.
       And look'd down over Attica; or he
     And look'd extremely at the opening door,
       And look down on the universe with pity,—
       And look'd upon it long, and when at last
       And look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek
       And looking, as he always look'd, perceived
     And looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,
       And looking coldly in her face, he cried,
       And looking like two incubi, they glared

       And looking on him with a sort of smile,
       And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,

     And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,
     And lose their own in universal death.
     And lost in wonder of so great a nation,
       And lost virginity of oratory,
     And louder than her breathing beats her heart.
     And lo! upon that day it came to pass,
       And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest
       And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings
     And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.
       And love of glory 's but an airy lust,
       And Love 's a god, or was before the brow
     And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,
     And love than either; and there would arise
     And love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'
       And love too much, and yet can not love less;
     And lower the price of rouge—at least some winters.
       And lying on their weariness like balm,
       And made a loud and pious lamentation;
     And made a scene men do not soon forget;
       And made a signal to retreat at one.
     And made at least five hundred good zecchini,
     And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.
     And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.
       And made them bale without a moment's ease,
     And made them charge with bayonet these machines,
     And made the very billows pay them toll.
       And made thy best interpreter a sigh?
       And made upon the hot-house several strictures,
       And make a music, whether flat or sharp.
       And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?
       And make no further noise, till you discover
     And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.
       And makes our snow less pure than our morality;
       And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,
     And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.
     And Malthus does the thing 'gainst which he writes.
     And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.
       And many deaths do they escape by this:

     And march away—'t were easier done than said.'
       And marriage also may exist without;
       And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;
       And matrons who would be no less secure,

     And now being femininely all array'd,
     And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,
     And now commenced a strict investigation,
     And now delay the progress of Don Juan,
     And now he rose; and after due ablutions
     'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown
     And now in this new field, with some applause,
       And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'
     And now I will give up all argument;
     And now I will proceed upon the pair.
     And now my epic renegade, what are ye at
     And now nought left him but the muffled drum.'
     'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
     And now, that we may furnish with some matter all
       And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,
     And now there was a general sensation
     And now they were diverted by their suite,
     And now to business.—O my gentle Juan,
     And now to see them, thus divided, stand
     And now 't was done—on the lone shore were plighted
     And now—what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?
     And now would chain them, to the very mind:—
     And numerous party of his noble friends;
     And oaks as olden as their pedigree
       And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:
     And o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,
     And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised
     And o'er his eye a momentary gloom
     And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,
       And of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;
       And offering, as usual, late assistance.
     And offer poison long already mixed.
       And of the folly of all prudish fears,
       And of this Baba willingly took note,
     And of variety there was no lack—
     'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear—
     And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!
     And oh! ye gentlemen who have already
       And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;
     And once o'er several country gentlemen.
     And one by one her articles of dress
     And one by one in turn, some grand mistake
     And one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose
     And one good action in the midst of crimes
     And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,
     And one oar for a mast, which a young lad
       And one on tithes, which sure are Discord's torches,
     And one or two sad, separate wives, without
       And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.
     And only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'
       And only think, or act, or feel, with reference

     And orders, and on all that he had done—
       (And other chief points of a 'bella donna'),
       And other minds acknowledged my dominion:
       And others, looking with a stupid stare,
     And others of themselves and latter ends.
     And others of twelve consonants apiece;
       And others rose to the command of crews
     And others still their appetites constrain'd,
     And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.
     And others went on as they had begun,
     And ought to go by quite another name.
     And our Sophias are not so emphatic,
       And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,
     And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,
     And pair their rhymes as Venus yokes her doves,
     And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,
       And palsied fancy, which no longer roves
       And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had
     And pass'd (at least the latter years of life)
       And pass'd for arguments of good endurance.
       And pass, for want of better, though not new:
     And Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,
       And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
     And Pegasus hath a psalmodic amble
       And Pegasus runs restive in his 'Waggon,'
     And pensive to her father's house she went,
     And persecuted sages teach the schools
     And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,
       And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,
       And pick it up, and bite it to the core;
       And pitying sore his mutilated case,
     And pity lovers rather more than seamen.
     And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.
       And place them on their breast—but place to die—
       And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,
     And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.
     And plumage (probably it might have err'd

       And pride my feeble:—let us ramble on.
       And promises to all—which last commenced
     And prophecy—except it should be dated
       And proved it—'t was no matter what he said:
     And prudently postpone, until mid-day,
       And pulling out reluctant purses, and
     And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife—
     And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,
     And put himself upon his good behaviour:
       And put his house in mourning several weeks,—
     And put the business past all kind of doubt.
     And quite enough for me to keep in mind;—
     And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those
     And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,
     And rally back his Romans to the field.
     And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.
     And rank'd with what is every day display'd—
       And rapture's self will seem almost a pain
       And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,
     And rash enthusiasm in good society
     And rated him almost a whipper-in.
     And rather calmly into the heart glides,
       And rather held in than put forth his vigour;
       And rather variably for stony death.
     And rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,
       And raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd
       And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?
     And read (the only book she could) the lines
     And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'

       And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;
     And recollect a poet nothing loses
     And recollect the time when all this cant
       And recollect the work is only fiction,
     And reconciled all qualities which grace man,
       And redly ran his blushing waters down.
     And rend'ring general that which is especial.
       And repetition 's tiresome and unwise,—
       And representative of all the race.
     And revell'd in the fancies of the time,
       And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,
       And rich with all contrivances which grace
       And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.
       And roar'd out, as he writhed his native mud in,
       And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.
     And rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,
     And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
       And round its once warm precincts palely lying
       And round them ran a yellow border too;
       And, running out as fast as I was able,
     And rushing in disorderly, though led,
     And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes

     And sang with much simplicity,—a merit
       And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
     And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
       And saw into herself each day before all
     And saw the sun set opposite the moon.
     And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,
       And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee
       And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since—
     And scent the prey their masters would attack all.
     And science profits by this resurrection—
       And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,
     And scorn to add a syllable untrue;
     And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,
     And sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;
       And seated her all drooping by his side,
     And, secondly, I pity not, because
     And secondly, must let slip no occasion,
       And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:
       And see a sentimental passion glow,
       And seem'd as if they had no further care;
       And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,
     And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
     And seem to say, 'Resist us if you can'-
     And self would know what duty to attend.'

       And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;
     And send the sentinel before your gate
       And sent one on a summons to the pair,
       And sent the doctors in a new direction.
     And seriously resolved on reformation.
       And serious more than pensive, and serene,
     And set the other halt of earth to rights;
       And settled bonnets by the newest code,
       And set up in their stead some proper stuff.
     And several of her best bon-mots were hawk'd about:
     And several pitied with sincere regret
     And several strutted, others slept, and some
     And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.
       And sharp Adversity, will teach at last
     And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,
             And shed the blood of Scio's vine!
       (And she had some not easy to withstand)
     And shells and shot of every size and shape.
       And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.
     And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;
     And she was chill as they, and on her face
       And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,
       And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,
     And she would have consoled, but knew not how:
     And she would softly stir his locks so curly,
     And shine the very Siria of the spheres,
           And ships, by thousands, lay below,
       And shiver them to ashes, but to trail
       And shone in the best part of dialogue,
       And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,
       And should he have forgotten her so soon?
       And (should she not hold fast by love or pride)
       And, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride,
       And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,
       And show'd but little royal curiosity:
     And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste
     And show that late hours, wine, and love are able
     And show them what an intellectual war is.
     And shriek for water into a deaf ear,—
     And shudder;—while, as beautiful as May,
     And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.
       And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;
     And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.
       And simple in the world, and doth not need
       And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
     And since that time it need not cost much showing,
     And since that time there has not been a second.
     And since 'there 's safety in a multitude
     And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,
     And singing birds without were heard to warble;
     And Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.
       And sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:
     And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.
     And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
     And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
     And slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb
     And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
       And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,
       And smiling but in secret—cunning rogue!
       And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud
     And smooth'd the brimstone of that street of hell
     And so all ye, who would be in the right
     And sober suns must set at five o'clock.
     And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?
     And Socrates, that model of all duty,
     And so farewell—forgive me, love me—No,
       And so for one will I, as well I may.
       And so good night.—Return we to our story:
     And so good night to them,—or, if you will,
     And so great names are nothing more than nominal,
     And so have been forgotten:—I condemn none,
     And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;
     And so he says no more—but pays his court
     And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
     And so I interfered, and with the best
     And so, in short, the girls they really were
     And so is spring about the end of May;
     And so it was, in proper time and place;
     And solace your slight lapse 'gainst 'bonos mores,'
     And sold him instantly when out of danger.
     And so may every one except a dunce,
     And some of them had lost their recollection,
       And some of them high names: I have also known
     And some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'
       And some seem'd much in love with their own dress.
     And some such visions cross'd her majesty,
       And something like a smile upon her cheek.
       And something roll'd before her in a sheet,
       And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;
       And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
       And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,
       And somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;
       And some who had but talent for their crest;
       And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.
     (And so, my sober Muse—come, let 's be steady—
     And so—she awoke with a great scream and start.
     And so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;
     And so she took the liberty to state,
     And so that no explosion cry 'Aroint
       And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream
       And so they fell in love;—she with his face,
       And so they were submitted first to her, all,
     And Southey lives to sing them very ill.
     And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,
       And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'
       And sparkled into basins, where it spent
       And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,
       And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise—
     And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who
     And spoke more of the baron than the monk.
       And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
     And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray
       And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
       And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er
       And starting, she awoke, and what to view?
       And still a sort of fisherman was he;
     And still it half calls up the realms of fairy,
       And still less guessing where they might be going;
     And still less was it sensual; for besides
       And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,
     And still more nearly to the place advancing,
     And still more women, spring from not employing
     And still pursues the right;—to curb the bad
       And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;
     And still they seem resentfully to feel
     And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.
       And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
       And stood within his hall at eventide;
     And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;
     And, strange to say, they found some consolation
     And stripp'd and look'd to—But why should I ad
     And strives to strangle him before he die.
       And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.
     And stumbled almost every step she made;
     And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,
     And such an end! that he who many a day
       And such are many—though I only meant her
     And such as they are, such my present tale is,
     And such a straw, borne on by human breath,
     And such I mean to make him when I reign.
       And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
     And such is victory, and such is man!
       And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;
     And such sweet girls—I mean, such graceful ladies,
       And such their creed was, till they were invaded,
     And such they are—and such they will be found:
       And such things as the entrails and the brains
     And such was she, the lady of the cave:
       And sulkily the river's ripple 's flowing,
     And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,
     And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all
       And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
     And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he
     And swearing if the infant came to ill
     And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,
     And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:
     And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,
     And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.
     And swimming long in the abyss of thought
       And taciturn Asiatic disposition
     And take all colours—like the hands of dyers.
     And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.
     And take my word, you won't have any less.
       And take what kings call 'an imposing attitude,'
       And taking hints in good part all the while,
     And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,
       And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,
       And talk'd away—and might have talk'd till now,
       And talk in tender horrors of our loathing
     And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,
     And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,
       And taught him when to be reserved or free:
     And tell me what you think of your great thinkers.
     And tells me to resume my story here.
       And tell them—But you won't, and I have prated
       And tenderness, and infancy; but now
       And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;
     And that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest
     And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.
     And that deep-mouth'd Boeotian 'Savage Landor'
       And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;
       And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
     And that his Argus—bites him by the breeches.
       And that his father was an honest blacksmith,
     And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,
     And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,
     And that in his confusion he had caught
     And that I sing of neither mine nor me,
       And that it is so everybody knows
     And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds
     And that outrageous appetite for lies
     And that, proceeding at a very high rate,
     And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,
     And that 's enough, for love is vanity,
       And that 's enough; succeeded in my youth,
     And that so loudly, that upstarted all
     And that 's one cause she meets with contradiction;
     And that 's one comfort for my lost advice,
     And that 's the cause no doubt why, if we scan
       And that 's their mode of furnishing supply:
     And that 's the moral of this composition,
       And that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;
     And that 's the reason I 'm so melancholy.
     And that's the reason why you do—or do not.
     And that still keeping up the old connection,
     And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
     And that their books have but one style in common—
       And that the medicine answer'd very well;
     And that the rest had faced unto the right
     And that they have been so we all have read,
     And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,
       And that was of a fascinating kind.
       And that which after all my spirit vexes,
       And that which chiefly proved his saving clause
       And that which farther aided them to strive
       And the blood 's lava, and the pulse a blaze,
     And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,
     And the calumniated queen Semiramis.
     And the deep passions flashing through her form
     And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear
       And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
       And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,
       And the hard frost destroy'd the scenting days:
       And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd
     And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly
     And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,
       And their compassion grew to such a size,
       And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,
     And theirs:—without a struggle for priority,
     And the long-boat's condition was but bad,
     And the Lord Henry was a great debater,
     And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.
     And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
       And the loud cannon peal'd his hoarsest strains,
     And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl
       And the mosque crescent struggled into sight
       And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
     And then—and then—and then—sit down and sup.
       And then as an improvement 't will be shown:
     And then a slave bethought her of a harp;
       And then before sighs cease; for oft the one
       And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;
     And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
     And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,
     And then decide, without great wrong to either,
     And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,
     And then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.
     And the new births of both their stale virginities
     And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,
     And then flew out into another passion.
       And then give way, subdued because surrounded;
     And then—God knows what next—I can't go on;
       And then he added, that he needs must say,
     And then he call'd his brethren to his aid,
     And then he danced;—all foreigners excel
     And then he had an ear for music's sound,
     And then he had good looks;—that point was carried
     And then held out his jugular and wrist.
     And then her dress—what beautiful simplicity
     And then her sex's shame broke in at last,
     And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.
     And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd
     And then he talk'd with him about Madrid,
     And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.
       And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
     And then he tried to muster all his patience.
     And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,
       And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;
       And then his only garment quite gave way;
       And then, if matters could be made up now;
     And then I have the worst dreams that can be,
     And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'
     And then into a hoarser murmur grew,
     And then men stare, as if a new ass spake
       And then moved on again with rapid pace;
       And then my stoicism leaves nought behind
     And then of course the circle much admires,
       And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
     And then of these some part burst into tears,
       And then once more his feelings back were brought,
       And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,
     And then retreated soberly—at ten.
     And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,
     And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:
       And then she had all Seville for abettors,
     And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,
     And then she looks so modest all the while.
       And then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe
     And then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,
       And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,
     And then the merchant giving change, and signing
     And then, the mid-day having worn to one,
     And then the mother cries, the father swears,
     And then there are such things as love divine,
     'And then there are the dancers; there 's the Nini,
     And then there 's the Grotesca—such a dancer!
       And then there was a general competition,
     And then there was—but why should I go on,
     And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,
     And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,
     And then they bound him where he fell, and bore
     And then—they calculated on his ransom.
     And then they left off eating the dead body.
     And then they look'd around them and despair'd,
     And then they stared each other's faces round:
       And then they were too many, though so few—
     And then this best and weakest woman bore
     And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;
       And then to be ashamed of such mistaking.
     And then went down the hatchway one by one.
     And then what proper person can be partial
     And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,
     And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,
     And then with violence the old ship righted.
     And then you overstrain yourself, or so,
     And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
     And the pale smile of beauties in the grave,
     And the pause follow'd, which when song expires
     And the perplexity could not be told
     And the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.
       And the Pope thunder excommunication,
     And there, a little shelter'd from the shot,
     And therefore all we have related in
     And, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth
       And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;
       And therefore have his volumes done such harm,
     And therefore I shall open with a line
     And therefore Juan now began to rally
       And therefore leave them to the purer page
     And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;
     And therefore of Circassians had good store,
       And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
     And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,
     And therefore side by side were gently laid,
     And therefore, though 't is by no means my way
     And therefore was she kind and gentle as
     And therefore we must give the greater number
     And therefore what I throw off is ideal—
     And therefore, when he ran away, he did so
     And therefore will I leave off metaphysical
     And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best
       And therefore worthy of commemoration:
     And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,
       And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
     And there he stood to take, and take again,
     And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater
     And there he went ashore without delay,
     And there in a kibitka he roll'd on
     And there is much which could not be appreciated
           And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,
       And there 's a courage which grows out of fear,
     And the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,
       And there we go:—but where? five bits of lead,
       And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
     And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,
     And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,
       And the sad, second moon grows dim again,
     And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
     And the same night there fell a shower of rain,
       And the sea dashes round the promontory,
     And these are things which ask a tender tear,
     And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,
     And these he call'd on; and, what 's strange, they came
     And these two tended him, and cheer'd him both
     And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;
       And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,
     And the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,
     And the sky shows that very ancient gray,
     And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
       And the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot
     And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,
     And the sweet consequence of large society,
       And the true Hymen (the first 's but a screen)—
     And the two are so mix'd with human dust,
     And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.
     And the two last have left me many a token
     And the unquiet feelings, which first woke
     And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;
     And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
     And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.
       And they continued battling hand to hand,
     And they had wasted now almost a quarter.
       And they must be or seem what they were: still
       And the young beams of the excluded sun,
       And they revealed, alas, that ere they should,
            And they seem of a parted soul.
     And they were happy, for to their young eyes
     And they who waited once and worshipp'd—they
       And they who watch'd her nearest could not know
     And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;
       And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect
     And thirdly he who brought you the despatch!
       And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills
       And this addition with such gems was bound
     And this, and his not knowing how much oats
     And this at present was her kind employment.
     And this is stronger than the strongest grape
     And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,
     And this omission, like that of the bust
     And this reflection brings me to plain physics,
     And this same state we won't describe: we would
     And this they say in language rather rough.
     And this was admirable; for so hot
     And this young fellow—say what can he do?
       And those that sate upon them, let it be
     And though, as you remember, in a fit
     And though at first their strength it might renew,
     And though he certainly ran many risks,
       And though her dignity brook'd no complaining,
       And though he wish'd extremely to get through
     And though his meaning they could rarely guess,
       And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,
     And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair
       And (though I could not now and then forbear
       And though I have seen many corpses, never
     And though it was no opiate, slumber crept
     And though not vainer from his past success,
     And though so much inferior, as I know,
       And though the duty wax'd a little hard,
     And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,
       And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,
       And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand
       And thought. I say no more—I 've said too much;
     And though 't is true that man can only die once,
     And though 't was not much to a naval mind,
     And three dead, whom their strength could not avail
     And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
       And through her dear brunette complexion shone
     And throw down old—which he call'd restoration.
     And throwing back a dim look on his sons,
     And thrown into the sea.—Thus Baba spoke
       And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,
     And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,
     And thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee
     And thus Death laughs,—it is sad merriment,
     And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,
     And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,
     And thus heroically stood resign'd,
     And thus in every look she saw exprest
     And thus I supplicate your supposition,
     And thus it was with this our hapless crew;
     And thus like to an angel o'er the dying
     And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as
       And thus my narrative proceeds:—Dudu,
       And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach
       And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,
       And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre
     And thus they form a group that 's quite antique,
     And thus they form'd a rather curious pair,
     And thus they left him to his lone repose:
     And thus they parted, each by separate doors;
     And thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,
     And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,
     And thus upon his elbow he arose,
     And thus we see—who doubts the Morning Post?
     And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's
     And thus your houri (it may be) disputes
       And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?
     And till she doth, I fain must be content
     And Time had nothing more of night nor day
     And timidly expanding into life.
     And tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,
          And 't is held as faith, to their bed of death
       And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks
     And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
       And took his kingdom from him: You will find,
     And, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.
       And to the beauties of a foreign dame,
     And trace it in this poem every line:
     And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,
     And transient, and devour'd by the same harpy.
       And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
     And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;
       And tremulously gentle her small hand
     And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.
     And tried to make a landing on the main;
     And tried to perch, although it saw and heard
       And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;
       And trousers not so tight that they would burst,
     And truant husband should return, and say,
     And truculent distortion of their tresses.
     And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,
       And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
       And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,
       And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,
       And tumble downward like the flying fish
       And tune the concord to a finer mood.
       And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.
     And turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!
     And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,
     And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.
       And turning human nature to an art.
     And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
     And turn on things which no aristocratic
       And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,
       And twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;
     And 't will perplex the casuist in morality
     And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,
     And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;—
       And usual—Juan, when he cast a glance
       And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,—
       And vegetables, all in masquerade,
     And very handsome supernatural scenery.
     And very much unlike what people write.
       And vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;
       And wafted far arose a rich perfume:
       And waited but the signal's voice to burst
     And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,
     And walking out upon the beach, below
       And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;
       And wander'd up and down as in a dream,
       And warm, in case by chance he should awake,
       And was beleaguer'd both by land and water
     And was not likely all at once to burst
       And was not the best wife, unless we call
       And was not to be held in leading strings;'
     And was received with all the due grimace
       And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:
     And watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much
     And watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,
     And watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew
     And Waterloo has made the world your debtor
     And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,
       And waxing chiller in her courtesy,
       And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,
     And wear my head, denying that I wear it.
       And wear the Melton jacket for a space:
       And wedded unto one she had loved well—
       And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;
     And went down to the grave unborn, wherein
     And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,
     And were her object only what 's call'd glory,
     And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,
     And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger
     And what is strangest upon this strange head,
     And what is that? Devotion, doubtless—how
     And what is worse still, a much longer story:
     And—what is worst of all—won't let you go:
     And what I write I cast upon the stream,
     And what not, though he rode beyond all price,
          And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,
     And what 's still stranger, left behind a name
     And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'
     And what they pleased to do with the young khan
       And, what was stranger, never look'd behind;
     And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.
     And what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,
     And, when a holiday upon them smiles,
       And, when a strong although a strange sensation
       And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,
     And when at last the pretty creature gets
     And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,
            And when aught is to befall
       And when he did, he found himself at sea,
       And when he look'd upon his watch again,
     And when he walk'd down into the saloon,
     And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,
     And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,
     And when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd
     And when I think upon a pot of beer—
     And when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'
       And when she saw him stumbling like a steed
     And when so, you shall have the overture.
     And when the delicacies of the law
     And when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,'
     And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
           And when the sun set where were they?
       And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,
       And when they deem'd its moisture was complete
     And when they grew so—on their new-found lantern,
     And when they have made the shore through every shock,
     And when those deep and burning moments pass'd,
     And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.
       And when to hold his tongue, now held it till
       And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;
     And when upon a silent, sullen day,
     And when well practised in these mimic scenes,
     And when we once were fairly out, and when
     And when you add to this, her womanhood
     And when you hear historians talk of thrones,
     And when you may not be sublime, be arch,
           And where are they? and where art thou,
       And wherefore blame gaunt wealth's austerities?
     And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,
     And wherefore this exordium?—Why, just now,
       And where is 'Fum' the Fourth, our 'royal bird?'
     And where—oh, where the devil are the rents?
       And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?
     And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,
     And whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify
          And whether for good, or whether for ill,
       And whether he had occupied their station;
     And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?
     And whether it ought not to be disclosed,
     And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is—
     And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?
       And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
       And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose
       And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'
     And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'—consented.
       And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.
       And whom for this at last must we condemn?
     And who should die to be his fellow's food.
       And who that recollects young years and loves,—
     And why and wherefore no one understands.
     And why? because a little—odd—old man,
     And why?—because it brings self-approbation;
     And why? because she 's changeable and chaste.
       And why should I not form my speculation,
     And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin
     And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
       And will not toss and chatter the night through.
     And wins even by a delicate dissent.
     And wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint.
     And wish'd it death in which he had reposed;
       And wish'd that others held the same opinion;
       And wishing that post-horses had the wings
       And witches unto none, though somewhat late
       And with all passions in their turn attack'd;
       And with an air, to say the least, imperious,
       And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,
     And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.
     And with it all the process of digestion.
       And without that, their poison and their claws
     And without turning his facetious head,
       And without word, a sign her finger drew on
     And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it
       And with that gentle, serious character,
       And with them their two sons, of whom the one
       And with the pages of the last Review
     And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,
     And womankind too, if we so may say,
       And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
     And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,
       And wonder Providence is not more sage.
     And wonders why the devil he got heirs.
       'And wonder what old world such things could see,
       And won't say 'Yes,' and keeps you on and off-ing
       And words repeated after her, he took
       And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.
       And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;
     And Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion
     And work away like spirit upon matter,
     And works of the same pottery, bad or good,
       And worse off than we hitherto have been;
     And worthy of the noblest pedigree
     And would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,
     And would not brook at all this sort of thing
     And wounded several shutters, and some boards.
       And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,
     And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,
       And written lately two memoirs upon't),
     And yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise.
     And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,
     And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.
     And yet at last he managed to get through
     And yet but made a middling grenadier.
     And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
     And yet great heroes have been bred by both.
       And yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone
       And yet his looks appear'd to sanction both,
     And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,
     And yet I know no more than the mahogany
     And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
       And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,
     And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
       And yet last night, being at a masquerade,
     And yet, like all men else, I must allow,
     And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
     And yet she did not want to reach the moon,
       And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,
     And yet the British 'Damme' 's rather Attic:
     And yet the forest leaves seem'd stirr'd with prayer.
     And yet their present hope was hardly more
     And yet the rest rush'd eagerly—no wonder,
     And yet they had their little jealousies,
     And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.
       And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,
       And yet 't is not affected, I opine.
       And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink
       And yet was what you are: from ear to ear
     And yet what are your other evidences?
     And yet who can believe it? I would shatter
     And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,
       And you an equal courtesy should show.'
     And you may get the wedding dresses ready.
       And young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,
     And young beginners may as well commence
     And your cold people are beyond all price,
       And your true feelings fully understood,
       And you shall see who has the properest notion
       And you will be perhaps surprised to find
     And you will find her sum of years in plenty.
     And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror
       And you will find us not top fond of joking.'
       And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,
     And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and
     An earthly paradise of 'Or Molu.'
     An Eastern anti-jacobin at last
     A neat, snug study on a winter's night,
     An echo of a syllable that 's wrong:
     An edifice no less sublime than strong,
       An emerald aigrette with Haidee's hair in 't
       An end to answer, or a plan to lay—
     An English autumn, though it hath no vines,
     An English lady ask'd of an Italian,
     An English naval officer, who wish'd
       An epic from Bob Southey every spring),
       An erring woman finds an opener door
     A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye
       A—never mind; his tutor, an old ass;
     An evolution oft performed of late).
     An exquisite small chapel had been able,
     An eye 's an eye, and whether black or blue,
     Angle, the soi-disant mathematician;
     An honest friendship with a married lady—
     An honest gentleman at his return
     An 'ignis fatuus;' or as sailors stranded
       An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;
     An independent being in his day—
     An in-door life is less poetical;
     An infant when it gazes on a light,
     An innocent predominance annex,
       An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;
     An ivory inlaid table spread with state
     Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;
     Announced with no less pomp than victory's winner:
     Announcing the appointment of that lover of
     A noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.
       An 'Oh!' or 'Ah!' of joy or misery,
     A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,
       An old, old monastery once, and now
       An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;
       A non-descript and ever-varying rhyme,
     Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall
     An only son left with an only mother
     Anon—she was released, and then she stray'd
     An open brow a little mark'd with care:
       An opium dream of too much youth and reading,
     An orator of such set trash of phrase,
       An orator, the latest of the session,
     An order from her majesty consign'd
       An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;
     Another column also suffer'd much:—
           Another despot of the kind!
       Another gentle common-place or two,
     Another outcry for 'a little boat,'
     Another part of history; for the dishes
     Another time he might have liked to see 'em,
       An outline of the customs of the East,
     A novel word in my vocabulary.
     'An oyster may be cross'd in love,'—and why?
       Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:
     Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.
       Anticipating aught about the matter:
       Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,
       Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'
     Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,
       Antonia let him—not a little sore
       (Antonia! let me have a glass of water).
     Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,
     Antonia's patience now was at a stand—
     Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,
     Antonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?'
       An uniform to boys is like a fan
     An unknown barren beach for burial ground.
       An usurer could scarce expect much more—
       A nymph and her beloved, all unseen
       Any one else—they were become traditional;
     A page where Time should hesitate to print age,
     A pail of housemaid's water unawares.
     A pair of shoes!—what then? not much, if they
       A pair of trousers of flesh-colour'd silk;
       A panoramic view of hell 's in training,
     A paper kite which flies 'twixt life and death,
       A paradise of hops and high production;
     A paragraph in every paper told
     A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,
     Apart from one who had no sin to show,
     Apart from the surrounding world, and strong
     A parting pang, the spirit from her past:
     A path, to add his own slight arm and forces
       A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:
     A perfect transformation here display'd;
       A peril—not indeed like love or marriage,
       A period something like a printed page,
     A phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,
       A phantom upon each of the four posts;
     A picture is the past; even ere its frame
     A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,
       A place where peccadillos are unknown;
       A pleasant thing to young men at their years.
     A pleasure before which all others vanish;
       A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd
       A pleasure—like all pleasures—rather dear;
     A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;
     Apologue, fable, poesy, and parable,
     A poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign
     A portion of their beef up from below,
     A portion of your fading twilight hues,
       Apostasy's so fashionable too,
     Appearances appear to form the joint
       Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who
       Appear'd to him but as the magic vapour
     Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint
     A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn'd
       A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;
     A pretty name as one would wish to read,
     A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,
     A pretty stranger without friend or guide,
       A pretty town, I recollect it well—
     A pretty woman (that 's quite natural,
     A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.
     A priest the other—at least so they say:
       A Prince, the prince of princes at the time,
       A prodigy—her morning dress was dimity,
     A prologue which but slightly harmonised
       A prop not quite so certain as before:
       A proud humility, if such there be,
     Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.
     A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,
       A purple hectic play'd like dying day
     Aq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae
     A quality agreeable to woman,
     A quantity of clothes fit for the back
       A quantity of palisades upright,
       A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
     A quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'
       (A race of mere impostors, when all 's done—
       A rack of pleasures, where we must invent
     A rake turn'd methodistic, or Eclectic
       A range or suite of further chambers, which
     'Arcades ambo,' id est—blackguards both.

     Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.
     Are apt to carry things with a high hand,
     Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,
       Are bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,
       A red lip with two rows of pearls beneath

     Are gather'd round us by thy look of rest;
       Are generally prosperous in reigning;
       Are good manure for their more bare biography.
       Are grown of the beau monde a part potential:
       Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.
     Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.
       Are longer lived than others,—God knows why,
     Are masks it often wears, and still too late.
             A remnant of our Spartan dead!
     Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.
       Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons
     Are, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!
     Are over: Here 's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'
     Are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),
       Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:
     Are puzzles to the most precautious benches.
     Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.
     Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.
     Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
     Are saving—vice spares nothing for a rarity.
     Are similes at hand for the distress
     Are so divine, that I must deem them real:—
     Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,
       Are spurn'd in turn, until her turn arrives,
       Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
       Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,
     Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)
     Are there oft dull and dreary as a dun—
       Are the true lords of Europe. Every loan
       Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:
     Are they—now furious as the sweeping wave,
       Are things immortal to immortal man,
       Are things that really take away the breath,—
       Are things the turning of a hair or feather
     Are things which in this century don't strike
       Are things which make an English evening pass;
       Are topics which I sometimes introduce,
     Are touch'd with a desire to shield and save;—
     Are true as truth has ever been of late.
        Are tutors, guardians, and so forth, compared
     Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.
     Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say
       Are various, but they none of them are dull;
     Are very silent when they once believe
     Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
     Are what I found there—but the devil a Phrygian.
     Are wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe
       Are worse than the worst damages men pay
       A rib 's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,
     A rich confusion form'd a disarray
     A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,
       Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,
     Arise, when we see emperors fall with oats!
       Arising out of business, often brought
       Aristocratic as was ever seen,
       Arms to which men will never more resort,
     Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
     A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;
     Around, as princess of her father's land,
       Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm
       Around them, made them to each other press,
       Around them (what I hope will never vanish)
     Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake
       Around us ever, rarely to alight?
     A row of gentlemen along the streets
       A royal husband in all save the ring—
     Arranging them like books on the same shelf,
     Arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,
       Array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil.
       Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,
       Arrived, retired to his; but to despond
     Arriving at the summit of a hill
     Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery
     A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all
     A Russian officer, in martial tread
     A Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;
     A Russ or Turk—the one 's as good as t' other.
       As acids rouse a dormant alkali),
     A sad miscalculation about distance
       A sad old fellow was he, if you please;
       A sad, sour, sober beverage—by time
     A sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long.
       As after reading Athanasius' curse,
     As a full pot of porter, to their thinking
       As a great favour one of the fore-paws,
     A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,
       As all have found on trial, or may find,
       As all his latter meals had been quite raw,
     As all must blend whose part it is to aim
     As all truths must, the more they are disputed:
     As also at the race and county balls.
     As also bonfires made of country seats;
       As also did Miss Protasoff then there,
       As also of the first academicians:
       As an amusement after the Divan;
       As an East Indian sunrise on the main.
     As an old temple dwindled to a column.
     As any body on the elected roll,
     As any man's day mixture undergoes.
       As any mention'd in the histories
       As any of Mortality's conditions;
       As any other boon for which men stickle.
     As any other notion, and not national);—
     As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.
       As are the billows when the breeze is brisk—
     As a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.
     As 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,
       A savage sort of military martyr.
     As a volcano holds the lava more
     As Baba with his fingers made them fall
       As beautiful and bounding as a steed,
     As beautiful as her own native land,
     As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,
     As being the best judge of a lady's case.
     (As being the brave lions' keen providers)
       As better knowing why they should be so,
     As between English beef and Spartan broth—
     As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.
       As bold as Daniel in the lion's den,
     As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,
     As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;
     As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.
       As but to lovers a true sense affords;
     As Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.
       As Captain Parry's voyage may do to Jason's.
     As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing
       A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,
       As cavalier servente, or despise her;
     As certain;—these are paltry things, and yet
     A schooner, or—but it is time to ease
       As clear as such a climate will allow;
     A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill
     As common soldiers, or a common—shore,
       As congresses of late do) of the Lady
     As day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,
     As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.
       As did the Cynic on some like occasion;
     As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.
     As do the subtle snakes described of old.
       As doubtless should be people of high birth.
       As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit
       As eager to anticipate their grave;
     A second for her excellent connections;
     A second hiccup'd, 'Our old master 's dead,
       A second principle of life, which might
     A second time desired him to kneel down,
     As e'er brought man and woman to the brink
       As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
       As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:
     As e'er was locust on the land it blasted.
       As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;
       As Eldon on a lunatic commission—
     A sentimental friendship through and through,
       A sentiment till then in her but weak,
       As ere that awful period intervenes
       As even in a much humbler lot had made
       As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.
     As ever Mahomet pick'd out for a martyr,
     As ever yet was any work sublime,
     (As every kind of parting has its stings),
     As every paltry magazine can show its.
     As every rising wave his dread renew'd;
     As fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.
       As far as her own gentle heart allow'd,
       As far as I know, that the church receives:
     As far as in her lay, 'to take him in,
     As far as outward show may correspond;
     (As far as rhyme and criticism combine
       (As far as words make rules), our common notion
     As fast as ever husband by his mate
       As fast as oars could pull and water float;
       As fattest; but he saved himself, because,
     As few would ever dream could form the link
       As flourishing in every Christian land,
     As for a brook to cope with ocean's flood;
     As for his place, he could but say this of it,
     As form a science and a nomenclature
     'As for the figuranti, they are like
     As for the ladies, I have nought to say,
     'As for the men, they are a middling set;
     As for the other two, they could not swim,
       As gallantly as ever heroes fought,
     As going at full speed—no matter where its
     As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.
       As great a scorner of the Nazarene
     As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,
       A shadow which the onward soul behind throws:
       As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.
     As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.
       A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst,
       As he before had done. He did not heed
       (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river
     As hell—mere mortals who their power abuse—
     As he look'd down upon his children gone,
     'Ashes to ashes'—why not lead to lead?
       As he turn'd o'er each pale and gory cheek,
     As he who studies fervently the skies
     As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)
       As human beings, or his ways are odd.
     Asia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.
       Aside his very mirror soon was put;
       As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,
       As if born for the ministerial trade.
     As if Death were more dreadful by his door
       As if each charming word were a decree.
     As if he had combated with more than one,
     As if he had three lives, as well as tails.
     As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
       As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
     As if he wish'd that she should fare less ill
       As if his veins would pour out his existence,
     As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'
       As if not warn'd sufficiently by those
     As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.
       As if she had just now from out them crept:
       As if she had received a sudden blow,
       As if she pitied her for being there,
       As if she rated such accomplishment
     As if she rather order'd than was granting.
       As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:
     As if their last day! of a happy date
       As if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,
       As if the milky way their feet was under
     As if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented
     As if there were no life beneath the sky
       As if they acted with the heart instead,
       As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.
     As if to ask how you can dare to keep
       As if to win a part from off the weight
       As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
     As if 't would to a second spring resign
     As if well used to the retreating trade;
     A sigh from his heaved bosom—and hers, too.
     A sight on which he had not lately gazed,
     As I have said in—I forget what page;
       As I have said, upon an expedition;
       A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.
       As I 'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:
     A sincere woman's breast,—for over-warm
       As in freemasonry a higher brother.
     A single cry would bring them all abroad:
       A single laugh demolish'd the right arm
       A single shade 's sufficient to entrance
       A single tear upon his eyelash staid
     As is a slave by his intended bidder.
       As is a theatre lit up by gas.
       As is the Christian dogma rather rough,
       As is the custom of those Eastern climes,
       As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,
     A situation difficult, I ween,
       (As it will look sometimes with the first stare,
       As I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;
     As Juan mused on mutability,
     As Juan should have known, had not his senses
       As Juan was a person of condition,
       Ask a blind man, the best judge. You 'll attack
     Ask'd next day, 'If men ever hunted twice?'
     As leaving a small family at large.
     Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,
     A sleep without dreams, after a rough day
       A slender streak of blood announced how near
       A slice or two from your luxurious meals:
     A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind
     A slight example, just to cast a shade
       A slight glance thrown on men of every station.
       A slight observer in a modest way),
     A slight repast makes people love much more,
     As little as the moon stops for the baying
     As Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,
     A small old spaniel,—which had been Don Jose's,
       As many covers, duly, daily, laid.
     As many doubts as any other doctrine
     As many guests, or more; before whom groan
     As many other noble scions were;
     As may be won by favour of the moon
     As morning broke, the light wind died away,
       As most at his age are, of hope and health;
     As most essential to their hero's story,
       As most men do, the little or the great;
     As much from mobs as kings—from you as me.
       As much of German as of Sanscrit, and
       As music chimes in with a melodrame.
       As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:
     (As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges
     As not being in a masquerading mood,
       As now might render their long suffering less:
       As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;
       As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.
     As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
     As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.
     As obstinacy, both in men and women,
       As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.
     As o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.
       As o'er him the calm and stirless air:
       As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,
            As o'er the grass the dew.
     A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
     A something all-sufficient for the heart
       A something in them which was not desire,
     A something like it, as bear witness Luther.
     A something to be loved, a creature meant
     A something wherewithal to be annoy'd.
     As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)
     As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.
     As one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,
       As one who, though he were not of the race,
     As one who was a lady in the land.
     As on the beach the waves at last are broke,
       As on the whole it is an even chance
     A sorrier still is the great moral taught
       A sort of ignis fatuus to the mind,
       A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
     A sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,
       A sort of treaty or negotiation
     A sort of varnish over every fault;
       As Ovid's verse may give to understand;
     As passion rises, with its bosom worn,
     As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;
       A special Titian, warranted original,
       A spectral resident—whose pallid beam
       A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:
     As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.
     As Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.
     (As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.
     As plentiful as in a court, or fair.
     As à propos of hope or retrospection,
     As pure as sanctity itself from vice,
     As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most
     As purple to the Babylonian harlot:
       A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,
     As rare in living beings as a fossile
     As rarely they beheld throughout their round;
     As renegadoes; while in hapless group,
     As roll the waters to the breathing wind,
       As roll the waves before the settled wind;
       As rum and true religion: thus it was,
     As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
     As say that Wellington at Waterloo
       As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,
       Assembled with our hostess and mine host.
       As serious as if I had for inditers
       As several people think such hazards rude.
       As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.
       As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,
       As some have qualified that wondrous place:
       As some one somewhere sings about the sky,
       As sometimes happens in a great extremity;
     As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;
     As some who labour more and yet may charm less.
     As soon as 'Crowner's quest' allow'd, pursued
     As soon as they re-enter'd their own room,
     As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise
     As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair
     As suited the ensemble of his toilet,
       As suits a matron who has play'd a prank;
     Assume, then leave us on our freezing way.
       As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,
     A stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;
     As terrible as that of Ilion,
     As that abominable tittle-tattle,
     As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?'
     As the black eunuch enter'd with his brace
     As the far bell of vesper makes him start,
       As the first Canto promised. You have now
       As the last link with all she had held dear;
     As the mere pastime of an idle day,
     As the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'
     As the real purpose of a pyramid.
       As there were but two blankets for a sail,
       As the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd
     As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,
     As the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,
     As the sole sign of man's being in his senses
       As the tribunals show through many a session,
       As they beheld; the younger cast some leers
       As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,
     As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen
     As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves
     As they were plodding on their winding way
     As they were threading on their way, there came
       As they who print them think is necessary,
     As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.
       As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:
     As those of Aristotle, though sometimes
       As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:
     As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,
     As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,
     As those whose wives have made them fit for heaven.
       As though the lurking thought had follow'd free.
       As though there were one heaven and none besides,—
     As though they were in a mere Christian fair
       As though they were quite conscious of her station—
     As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,
     As thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd spell
     As thus Juanna spoke, Dudu turn'd round
     As thus: 'On Thursday there was a grand dinner;
     As tigers combat with an empty craw,
       A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
     As to announce his visits a long while
     A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,
     As touch'd, and plaintively began to play
     A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.
     A 'strange coincidence,' to use a phrase
     A stranger' dying, with so white a skin.
     A strange sensation which she must partake
       As travellers follow over bog and brake
     A strong external motive; and in this
     A subject of sublimest exultation—
       A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
     A sun emboss'd in gold, whose rays of tissue,
       A supernatural agent—or a mouse,
     As upon such occasions tars will ask
     As usual—the same reason which she late did.
       As Venus rose with from the wave, on them
     As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.
     As warm in heart as feminine in feature.
       As was the case, at least, where I have been;
       As water through an unexpected leak;
     As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
     As well as dilettanti in war's art,
       As well as further drain the wither'd form:
       As well as the sublime discovery's date,
     As we may ascertain with due precision,
     As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,
     As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,
     As what is lost in green is gain'd in yellow.
       As when she rose upon us like an Eve,
       As when the French, that dissipated nation,
     As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.
       As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?
       As wide as if a long speech were to come.
     As wife and friends did for the boils of job,—
     As will environ a conspicuous man. Some
       As with an effort she began to speak;
     As women hate half measures, on the whole,
     As wondering what the devil a noise that is.
     As yet are strongly stinging to be free.
       A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,
     As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:
       As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers
       At all such auctions knew how to prevail:
       At a long date—till they can get a fresh one—
       At anchor under the seraglio wall;
     At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,
     At a sad discount: while your over chilly
       A taste seen in the choice of his abode,
       At being disappointed in your wish
     At best, no better than a go-between.
     At Blank-Blank Square;—for we will break no squares
     A tear or two, and then we make it up;
     At eighteen, though below her feet still panted
     A tendency to under-rate and scoff
     A term inexplicable to the Muse.
       A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,
     At every jolt—and they were many—still
       At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,
     At first he did not think the women pretty.
     At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
     At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,
     At first, then kindling into animation,
       At great assemblies or in parties small,
     At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,
     At Halifax;' but now he served the Tartars.
       At hand, as one may like to have a fan,
     A thankless husband, next a faithless lover,
        A theme for pity or some worse emotion;
     At Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,
       (A thing approved as saving time and toil);—
     A thing in footing indispensable;
       A thing of impulse and a child of song;
     A thing of much less import in that clime—
     A thing of temperament and not of art,
       A thing, of which similitudes can show
     A thing quite necessary to the elect,
     A thing to counterbalance human woes:
       A thing to human feelings the most trying,
       A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;
     A thing which each endearment more endear'd.
     A thing which happens everywhere each day—
       A thing which happens rarely: this he owed
       A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,
       A thing which victory by no means boded
       (A thing with poetry in general hard).
     A third, because there can be no objections.
     A third's all pallid aspect offer'd more
       At home, far more than ever yet was Love—
     At home it might have given her some vexation;
       A thorough varmint, and a real swell,
     A thousand and a thousand colours they
       A thousand perils in this dubious shape.
       A thousand pities also with respect
     A thousand scimitars await the word;
       A thousand times of him had made an end;
       A thousand warriors by his word were kept
     A throne, the world, the universe, to be
       At human power and virtue, and all that;
       A tide of well-clad waiters, and around
     A tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,
     A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,
     At Keswick, and through still continued fusion
       At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
     At last fall sick of imitating Job.
     At last her father's prows put out to sea
     At last it takes to weapons such as men
       At last may get a little tired of thunder;
     At last they did get at it really, but
     At last they reach'd a quarter most retired,
     At last they settled into simple grumbling,
     At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he
     At least,—and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,
       At least as far as bienseance allows:
     At least entirely—for he had seen too many
       At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.
       At least, had he been nurtured in the north;
     At least he feels it, and some say he sees,
       At least he kept his vanity retired.
     At least he pays no rent, and has best right
       At least her conversation was obscure;
       At least his manner suffers not to guess
       At least in the beginning, ere one tires;
       At least it is a heavy sound to me,
       At least it rhymes to 'love;' but I 'm prepared
       At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy
       At least nine, and a ninth beside of ten.
       At least nine tenths of what we call so;—God
       At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:
       At least one of them!—Oh, the heavy night,
     'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
       'At least,' said Juan, 'sure I may enquire
     At least she left it a more slender handle.
       At least since the retirement of the Vandals,
       At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,
       At least they think so, to exert their state
     (At least this is the thing most people do).
     At least three parts of this great whole), she tore
       At least to all those who were left alive,
       At least to dream so loudly as just now;
       At least to follow those who might be so.'
       At least to those of incomes which afford
       At least 't was rather early to begin;
       At least we think so, though but few have guess'd
     At leaving even the most unpleasant people

     At length, in an imperial way, she laid
     At length one whisper'd his companion, who
     At length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,
     At length she rose up, and began to walk
     At length she said, that in a slumber sound
     At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,
     At length they caught two boobies and a noddy,
       At length they found mere cannonade alone
     At length they rose, like a white wall along
     At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning
       At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:
     At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.
     At making matches, where ''t is gold that glisters,'
     At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are
       At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
       At once adventurous and contemplative,
       At once her royal splendour, and reward
       At once the 'lie' and the 'elite' of crowds;
     At once without instalments (an old way
     At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift
       A topic scandal doth delight to rouse:
     At other times, repulsed by the close fire,
       A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,
     A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin.'
     A town which did a famous siege endure,
       At present I am glad of a pretence
       At present such things, since they are her theme,
     At present weigh'd down by a doom which had
       At quitting even those we quit in strife,
     A trace unworthy either wife or maid;—
       At risk of being quizz'd for superstition.
       A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
     At seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted
     At seven they rose, however, and survey'd

       At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,
     At sight, nor would permit you to discount.
       At six a charming child, and at eleven
     At six, I said, he was a charming child,
     At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,
     At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
       At some small distance, all he saw within
     At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,
       At such alliances his sires would frown,
       At such a pertinacious infidel,
       At sunset they began to take in sail,
       At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
       At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:
     At the first blush; for a fair Briton hides
     At the first notes, irregular and sharp,
       At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt—
       At the first two books having too much truth;
     At the full board, and sit alike delighted
       At the given signal join'd to their array;
     At the great end of travel—which is driving.

       Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,
     Attuned by voices more or less divine

     A turbot for relief of those who cram,
       A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,
       A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,
       At wassail in their beauty and their pride:
       At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian
       At whatsoever risk of being defeated.
       At which all modern nations vainly aim;
     At which Dudu look'd strange, and Juan silly;
       At which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;
       At which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved,
       At which the naval people are concern'd;
     At which the whole court was extremely troubled,
     At which your wise men sneer'd in phrases witty:

     Aurora—since we are touching upon taste,
     Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.
     Aurora, who in her indifference
     Aurora, who look'd more on books than faces,
     Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;

     A verdict—grievous foe to those who cause it!-
     A versified Aurora Borealis,
     A very handsome house from out his guilt,
     A vestal shrine of innocence of heart:
     A vigil or dreamt rather more than slept.

     A vigil there, where all but death should sleep.
     A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein
       (A virgin always on her maid relies)
     A virgin-like and edifying throng,
     A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,
       A visitant at intervals appears;
       A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,
     Avouch'd his death (such people never die),
     A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon
       Awaits at last even those who longest miss
     Awaits it, each new meeting or election.
     Awaits them, treachery is all their trust;
     Await those who have studied their bon-mots!
       A wanderer from the British world of fashion,
       A want of that true nature which sublimes
     Aware of their due royal rights o'er men.
     Aware this kind of baggage never thrives:
     A watchword till the future shall be free.

     A woman, so she 's good, what does it signify?
     A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,
       A woman's, true; but then there is a cause
     A 'wood obscure,' like that where Dante found
     A wordless music, and her face so fair
     A word which little suits with Seraskiers,

     Besides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,
     Besides being much averse from such a fate,
     Besides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall
     Besides, he had found out he was no tutor
     Besides, he had not seen of several hundred
     Besides, he had some qualities which fix
     Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
       Besides her maid's as pretty for their size;
     Besides, he was of that delighted age
     Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more
     Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air
     'Besides, I hate to sleep alone,' quoth she.
     Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,
     Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
     Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot
       Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
     Besides, I 've no more on this head to add;
     Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:
     Besides Platonic love, besides the love
     Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,
     Besides, so very beautiful was she,
     Besides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,
     Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense
     Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
       Besides the mark'd distinction of his air,
     Besides the ministers and underlings,
     Besides the most sublime of—Heaven knows what else:
     Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,
       Besides there might be falsehood in what 's stated:
     Besides, the sad 's a source of the sublime,
     Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,
     Bestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;
       Be such as I can properly accept;
       Be that the greater part were kill'd or wounded,
     Be too minute; an outline is the best,—
     Betraying only now and then her soul
     Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,
       Between his own and others' intellect;
     Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.
       Between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,
     Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave
     Between the British cabinet and Russian,
       Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,
     Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.
       Between their present and their future state;
     Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
     Between the present and past worlds, and hover
     Between these nations as a main of cocks,
       Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew;
     Between two worlds life hovers like a star,
       Between young persons without any danger.
       Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;—
     Be unimpeded by the proudest mosque.
          Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
       Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;
     Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,
     Beyond a single gentleman's belief.
     Beyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,—but would much rather
     Beyond the best apothecary's art,
       Beyond the charmers we have already cited;
       Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,
     Beyond the rules of posting,—and the mob
       Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,
       Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,
     Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show
       Bills, beasts, and men, and—no! not womankind!
     Bishops, who had not left a single sermon:
       Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,
     Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair
       Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allay'd,
       Blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,
     'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while
       Blood is not water; and where shall we find
     Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!
     Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range
     Blood, until heated—and even then his own
       Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;
       Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;
       Blue as the garters which serenely lie
     Blue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances
       Blushes for those who will not:—but to sigh
       Blushing and beardless; and yet ne'ertheless
       Blushing with Bacchant coronals along
       Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin
     Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,
     Bob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob.
     Bob Southey! You're a poet, poet laureate,
       Boded no good, whatever it express'd,
       Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend
     Boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.
     Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!
     Boldly referring to the list of peers
     'Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus,
     Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,—
       Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?
       Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,
     Born in a second wedlock; and above
     Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,—
     Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,
       Boscan, or Garcilasso;—by the wind
       Both busy (as a general in his tent
       Both in performance and in preparation;
       Both in the case of lover and of friend,
     Both lawyers and both men of education;
     Both long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish.
       Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,
     Both maladies are taxes on our joys:
     Both senates see their nightly votes participated
       Both to the duchess and diplomatist,
     Both were so young, and one so innocent,
     Both which are limited to no condition.
     Both wits—one born so, and the other bred—
     Bought up for different purposes and passions.
     Bows have they, generally with two strings;
       Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school
     Brave men were living before Agamemnon
     Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
       Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold
     Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
     Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,
       Bricklayer of Babel, call'd an architect,
     'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!'
       Brief, but delightful—such as had not staid
     Bright—and as black and burning as a coal;
       Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
     Bright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,
       Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,
     Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave
     Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet
       Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
       Bright with the very weakness he reproved;

     Broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,
       Broke foaming o'er the blue Symplegades;
       Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.'
     Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies
       Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:—
     Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,
     Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,
     Brought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,
       'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:
       Bull something of the lower world's condition.
       Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
       Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,
       Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;
     But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,
     'But add the words,' cried Henry, 'which you made;
     But Adeline determined Juan's wedding
     But Adeline had not the least occasion
     But Adeline was far from that ripe age,

     But Adeline was of the purest vintage,
     But Adeline, who probably presumed

     But, after all, 't is nothing but cold snow.
     'But after all, what is our present state?

     But all his great preparatives for dying
     But all that power was wasted upon him,
     But all the better, for the happy pair

     But an extraneous mixture, which no pen
       But an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!
     But apprehensive of his spectral guest,
     But as for Juan, he had no more notion
     But as he had some lucid intermissions,
     But as it happens to brave men, they blunder'd—
     But as it was, his Highness had to hold
     But as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all
     But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence?
     But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,—

       But as subservient to a moral use;
       But as the Danube could not well be waded,
     But as 'there 's safety' grafted in the number
     But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,
     But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,
     But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,
     But as to women, who can penetrate
     But a third motive was as probably

     But both together form a kind of centaur,
       But both were thrown away amongst the fens;
     But bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.
       But bred within the March of old Ancona,
     But buried in the heap of such transactions
       But by degrees, that they were fairer far
     But by degrees their senses were restored,
     But by dim lights the portraits of the dead
     But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,
       But by 'the bookish theoric' it appears,
     But by the mass who go below without
       But can't find any in the present age
     But 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'
     But certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,
     But certain 'tis they all felt for their new
     But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,

       But could not eat them, being in his turn

       But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,

       But death is imaged in their shadowy beams.
       But deems himself the first in Glory's van.
     But Destiny and Passion spread the net
     But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,
     But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
     But Donna Inez, to divert the train
     But don't pretend to settle which was best.
     But doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,
     (But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
     But doubtless they prefer a fine young man
       But do you more, Sempronius—don't deserve it,'
     But draw the long bow better now than ever.
     But dreams of what has been, no more to be.

       But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,
       But fair as then, or fairer to behold.
     But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,
     But finding no place for their landing better,
     But first of little Leila we 'll dispose;

     But for a child, what piece of work is here!
     But for domestic quarrels one will do.
     But for his judgment—never known to fail.
     But form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.
       But for my own peculiar superstition:
     But for post-horses who finds sympathy?
     But for that hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,
     But for the destiny of this young troop,
     But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.
     But for the present, gentle reader! and
       But for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known
       But for the rest, as he himself seem'd loth
       But found my very innocence perplex
     But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning
     But from the river the town 's open quite,
       But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,
             But gazing on each glowing maid,
     But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.
     But getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'
     But Glory's glory; and if you would find
     But go they must at once, and will I—nill I.
     But great things spring from little:—Would you think,
     But Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.
     But Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,
       But harrow up his feelings till they wither,
     But has not answer'd like the apparatus
     But have not learn'd to wish it any less.
     But hear that several people take exception
     But hear these freedoms form the utmost list

       But he had got Haidee into his head:
       But he had seen so much love before,
     But he, more modest, took an humbler range
     But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,—
     But here again, why will I thus entangle
     But here a messenger brought in despatches:
     But here are men who fought in gallant actions
     But here a small delay forms a great crime:
     But here a sort of scene began to ensue:
     But here he was!—where each tie that can bind
     But here I leave the general concern,
     But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,
     But here is one prescription out of many:
     But here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:
     But here Katinka interfered, and said,
     (But here perhaps the instances are fewer)
       But here the effect fell short of their desire:
     But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,
     But her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,
       But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:
     But he would not be taken, and replied
       But his adventures form a sorry sight;
          But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,
     But his just now were spread as is a cushion
     But, his life falling into Johnson's way,
     But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,
     But how shall I relate in other cantos
     But how to fill up that same vacant part?
     But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:
     But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred
     But I am not so sure I should have smiled
     But I am sick of politics. Begin,
     But I being fond of true philosophy,
     But I detest all fiction even in song,
     But I digress: of all appeals,—although
     But if a writer should be quite consistent,
     But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there
     But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;
     But if Love don't, Cash does, and Cash alone:
     But if she were deliver'd safe and sound,
       But if there 's anything in which I shine,
     But if the Sultan has a taste for song,
     But, if you can contrive, get next at supper;
     But I grow sad—and let a tale grow cold,
     But I have dined, and must forego, Alas!
     But I have motives, whether wise or silly,
     But I have spoken of all this already—
     But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.
     But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,
     But I 'm not OEdipus, and life 's a Sphinx.
     But I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,
       But I 'm resolved to say nought that 's amiss)—
       But I 'm too great a patriot to record
     But I 'm too late, and therefore must make play.
     But I must crowd all into one grand mess
     But I must do my duty—how thou hast
       But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;
     But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,
     But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.
     But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in
     But in a style becoming his condition.
     But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
     But in good company—the gout or stone.
     But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,
     But in his silence there was much to rue,
     But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,
     But innocence is bold even at the stake,
       But innocently so, as Socrates;
     But in old England, when a young bride errs,
     But in such matters Russia's mighty empress
     But in the country ladies seek their bower
     But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
     But in the noontide of the moon, and when
     But in the same small minute, every sin
       But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,
     But in this case I also must remark,
     But I shall add them in a brief appendix,
       But I suspect in fact that white is black,
     But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,
     But it is time that I should hoist my 'blue Peter,'
     But it suffices—little was amiss;
     But it was all a mystery. Here we are,
       But it will serve to keep my verse compact)—
     But I will fall at least as fell my hero;
       But I won't weep!—and so drive on, postilions!
     But Johnson only ran off, to return

     But Juan never left them, while they had charms,

     But Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,

       But Juan, season'd, as he well might be,
       But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,
       But Juan, trusting they might still get through,
     But Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child
     But Juan was a bachelor—of arts,
     But Juan was immovable; until
     But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero
     But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd
     But Juan was not meant to die so soon.
     But Juan was quite 'a broth of a boy,'
     But Juan was received with much 'empressement:'-
       But Juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,
       But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing
     But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
     But just remark'd with air sedate and wise,
     But just suppose that moment should betide,
     But just to play with, as an infant plays.
     But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
     But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.
     But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.
     But 'laissez aller'—knights and dames I sing,
     But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,
       But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;
     But leave them to the conscience of the nations.
     But let it go:—it will one day be found
     But let me change this theme which grows too sad,
     But let me put an end unto my theme:
       But let me quit the theme; as such things claim
     But let me to my story: I must own,
     But let that pass:—I think I have heard your name
       But let us die like men, not sink below
     But let us to the story as before.
     But, light and airy, stood on the alert,

       But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;
     But like two beings born from out a rill,

     But London 's so well lit, that if Diogenes
       But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,
     But lover, poet, or astronomer,
     But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,

     But luckily of no great length or weight.
     But making money, slowly first, then quicker,
     But man is a carnivorous production,

     But may their very memory perish too!-
     But merely their parental tenderness,

     But more imprudent grown with every visit,

     But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,

     But my best canto, save one on astronomy,
     But nature 's nature, and has more caprices
     But nature teaches more than power can spoil,
       But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime
     But neither love nor hate in much excess;
       But never in his real and serious mood;
     But never mind;—'God save the king!' and kings!
       But never mind,—she 'll turn, perhaps, next week;
       But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
     But never yet (except of course a miss
     But next to dressing for a rout or ball,
     But next, when I 'm engaged to sing there—do go.
       But no device could be brought into play—
       But no doubt every thing is for the best—
     But none of them appear'd to share his woes,
     But none of these possess'd a sting to wound her—
     But none were 'gene:' the great hour of union
     But no one doubted on the whole, that she
     But no one dreams of ever being short.-
     But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,
     But no one troubled him with conversation.
       But not a page of any thing that 's loose,
     But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.
       But not as yet imagined it could be
     But not at all adapted to my rhymes.
       But not a word could Juan comprehend,
     But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on
       But not by the same door through which came in
     But not enough to show the imperial halls,
       But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
       But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion
     But not my fault—I tell them all in time.
     But not the less for this to be depreciated:
        But not to go too far, I hold it law
       But not with violence; the stars shone out,
     But now at thirty years my hair is grey
     But now being lifted into high society,
     But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha
       But now I can't tell where it may not run.
     But now I choose to break off in the middle,
     But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,
     But now I 'm going to be immoral; now
     But now I must transfer her to the charge
     But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,
     But now it flow'd in natural and fast,
     But now it seems he's right, his notion just,
     But now I will begin my poem. 'T is
       But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,
     But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk'd about;
       But now reduced, as is a bulky volume
     But now their eyes and also lips were dry;
     But now there came a flash of hope once more;
     But now the town is going to be attack'd;
     But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.
     But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,
     But of all nature's discrepancies, none
     But of all truths which she has told, the most
     But of all verse, what most ensured her praise
     But) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests
       But of inferior materials: she
       But of materials that much shock the Muse—
     But of such friendship as man's may to man be
     But oft denied, as patience 'gins to fail, he
       But of the first, our little friend Don Juan
       But of the portion which attack'd by water,
     But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?
     But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!
     But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!
       But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!
     But—Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
     But oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,
     But once a week or fortnight, uninvited
     But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)
           But one arise,—we come, we come!'
     But one thing 's odd, which here must be inserted,
       But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted
     But one which Baba did not like to brave,
     But one who is not so youthful as she was
       But only give a bust of marriages;
     But on the thirteenth, when already part
     But on the whole their continence was great;
     But on the whole, to general admiration
     But on they march'd, dead bodies trampling o'er,
       But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,
     But other speculations were, in sooth,
     But others ponder'd on a new dissection,
     But others, who were left with scarce a third,
       But overwrought with passion and despair,
     But passion most dissembles, yet betrays
       But pays off moments in an endless shower
     But people's ancestors are history's game;
     But perish'd without shivering or shaking,
     But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,
     But pity him I neither must nor may
     But politics, and policy, and piety,
       But poor Dudu, with large drops in her own,
     But pray give back a little to the nation.
     But press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.
       But punn'd it down to this facetious phrase—
     But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,
     But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.
     But rather skim the earth; while Dudu's form
     But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,
       But red with no redeeming gore: the glow
     But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;
       But saddens more by night as well as day,
       But saddest when his science is well known:
       But sage Antonia cut him short before
     But Saint Augustine has the great priority,
     But scandal 's my aversion—I protest
     But scarce a fee was paid on either side
     But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon—
       But seats a nation or upsets a throne.
     But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,
     But seeing, flashing forward, like the day
     But seeing him all cold and silent still,
     But see the world is only one attorney.
     But seize the last word, which no doubt 's the best.
       But seldom pay the absent, nor would look
     But set those persons down with me to pray,
     But Shakspeare also says, 't is very silly
     But she defied all means they could employ,
     But she rose up, and kiss'd the matron's brow
     But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,
     But she was lucky, and luck 's all. Your queens
     But she was pensive more than melancholy,
     But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore
     But shortly he had cause to be content.
     But should the day come when place ceased to exist,
       But should we wish to warm us on our way
     But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,
       But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,
       But since they are, that epoch is a bore:
     But six old damsels, each of seventy years,
     But sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages,
     But slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,
       But small concern about the when, or where,
     But so far like a lady, that 't was drest
     But so far the immediate effect
     But so it was; and every preparation
     But sold by the impresario at no high rate.
     But somebody or other rummaging,
     But somehow,—it may seem a schoolboy's whine,
     But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
     But something of the spirit of old Greece
     But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.
     But sometimes stumbling over a potato,—
     But soon Philosophy came to my aid,
     But soon they grow again and leave their nest.
     But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,
       But speculating as I cast mine eye
       But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;
     But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.
       But still a fortress of the foremost rank,
     But still from that sublimer azure hue,
     But still her aspect had an air so lonely!
     But still he smiles; and whether near or far,
     But still his state was delicate: the hue
     But still I am, or was, a pretty poet.
     But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,
       But still I think I can collect my mind;
       But still it is so; and with such example
       But still no less suspects in the wrong place,
     But still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float
       But still so like, that Psyche were more clever
     But still there is unto a patriot nation,
     But still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,
     But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.
     But still 't is best to struggle to the last,
     But still we moderns equal you in blood;
          But still with the house of Amundeville
     But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,
       But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell
       But Strongbow's wit was of more polish'd breed:
       But such a godfather 's as good a card.
     But such as fit an Asiatic breech;
     But such intent I never had, nor have it;
     But such precipitation may end ill,
     But such small licences must lovers brook,
       But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
     But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
     But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,
       But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.
     But take an ell—and make a great sensation,
     But taking him into her father's house
     But tears must stop like all things else; and soon
     But that, at present, with immediate reference
       But that can't be, as has been often shown,
       (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);
     But that in love such idleness has been
     But that, like other things, has pass'd away,
     (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:
       But that of late your scribblers think it worth
       But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,
     But that 's her way with all men, till they 're tried;
       But that 's impossible, and cannot be—
       But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,
     But that they will not do without suspicion,
       But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
     But that which Donna Inez most desired,
       But that which more completely faith exacts
     But that with them all law would be demolish'd.
     But that you won't—then don't—I am not less free.
     But the best dish that e'er was cook'd since Homer's
     But the boy bore up long, and with a mild
       But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,
       But the fact is that I have nothing plann'd,
       But the fair face which met his eyes forbade
       But theirs was love in which the mind delights
            But the monk is lord by night;
       But then exceptions always prove its worth—
       'But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!
       But then, I beg it may be understood,
     But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
     But then she had a devil of a spirit,
     But then the Abbey 's worth the whole collection.
     But then the fact 's a fact—and 't is the part
       But then their own Polygamy 's to blame;
     But then there was a great want of precaution
     But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,
       But then the situation had its charm,
       But then the thought of parting made her quake;
     But then they have their claret and Madeira
     But then they never came to 'the Seven Towers;'
     But then they only seem so many brothers.
       But then they shone not on the poet's page,
     But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;
     But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.
     But then 't was to the purpose what she spoke:
       But then 't would spoil much good philosophy.
     But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,
     But the old marchioness some plan had hatch'd,
       But the old way is best for the purblind:
     But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,
     But there his project reach'd its utmost pitch
     But there is something when man's eye appears
     But there 's a conversational facility,
     But there 's another little thing, I own,
       But there 's a rumour which I fain would hush,
     But there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,
     But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,
     But there 's no shooting (save grouse) till September.
       But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,
     But there was something wanting on the whole—
     But there were ample reasons for it, none
     But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,
       But there were she and Juan, face to face—
       But the same cause, conducive to his loss,
     But the sea acted as a strong emetic. I
     'But these are but two Turkish ladies, who
     But these are few, and in the end they make
     But these are foolish things to all the wise,
     But these are my addresses from the throne,
     But these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,
     But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,
     But these precautionary hints can touch
       But the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope
     But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,
       But the stone bastion still remains, wherein
     But the tenth instance will be a tornado,
     But the town ditch below was deep as ocean,
       But the two youngest loved more to be set
     But they as soon shall circumcise my head!
       But they could not come at the leak as yet;
       But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);
     But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,
     But they who blunder thus are raw beginners;
     But they will not find Liberty a Troy:—
     But thinks less of good eating than the whisper
     But this can't well be true, just now; for writers
     But this has nought to do with their outsides.
     But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong
     But this I know, it was a spacious building,
     But this I know, that this roast capon 's fat,
       But this I must say in my own applause,
     But this is her seraglio title, got
     But this is not at present my concern,
     But this is not my maxim: had it been,
     (But this last simile is trite and stupid).
     But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,
     But this poor girl was left in the great hall,
     But this will more peculiarly be seen);
     But this won't do, save by and by; and he

       But those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise:
     But those who scaled, found out that their advance

     But though a 'bonne vivante,' I must confess
     But though I also had reform'd before
     But though I am a temperate theologian,
     But though I owe it little but my birth,
     But though my turn will not be served with less,
     But though the flower is different, with the French
     But though the soil may give you time and trouble,
     But though three bishops told her the transgression,
     But thought, like most men, there was nothing in 't
     But though your years as man tend fast to zero,
     But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.
       But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
     But thus it is some women will betray us.
       But thus much, and no sneer against the shore
     But till that point d'appui is found, alas!
       But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,
       But time strips our illusions of their hue,
     But time, the comforter, will come at last;
     But Time, which brings all beings to their level,
     But 't is a name so spread o'er 'Sir' and 'Madam,'
       But 't is as well at once to understand,
     But to continue:—I say not the first,
       But to continue: though her years were waning
     But to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,
       But to deny the mob a cordial, which is
     But Tom's no more—and so no more of Tom.
     But to my subject—let me see—what was it?-
     But to our subject: a brave Tartar khan—
     But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent
       But to proceed—for there is more behind:
     But to resume,—should there be (what may not
     But to resume. The languid Juan raised
     But to return,—Get very drunk; and when
     But to return unto the stricter rule
     But to sit up while others lie in bed,
     But to the main point, where we have been tending:—
     But to the narrative:—The vessel bound
     But to the tale:—great joy unto the camp!
       But true—as, if expedient, I could prove)
     But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,
           But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
     But 't was a public feast and public day,—
     But 't was a transient tremor;—with a spring
     But up she got, and up she made them get,
     But vaccination certainly has been
       But various as the various meats display'd:
     But very difficult, to shut their eyes.
       But very rarely executes its function,
     But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,
     But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
     But Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,
       But visions of an apple and a bee,
       But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,
     But was in them their nature or their fate:
       But was used sparingly,—some were afraid,
     But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,
       But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);
       But went to heaven in as sincere a way
     But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,
       But what conducted, if the question's fair,
     But what confused him more than smile or stare
       But what he did, is much what you would do;
     But what he did, was to lay on their backs,
     But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?
       But what I say is neither here nor there:
     But what is odd, none ever named the duke,
       But what is to be done? I can't allow
     But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed
       But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;
     But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,
       But what 's reality? Who has its clue?
     But what 's this to the purpose? you will say.
     But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;
       But what they please; and if that things be dear,
     But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,
       But what was not; a sort of style that 's grown
     But what was strange—and a strong proof how great

     But what with keeping some, and breaking others,

       But where thermometers sunk down to ten,
     But whether all, or each, or none of these
       But whether English dukes grew rare of late,
     But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords,
     But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,
       But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,
     But whether Julia to the task was equal
     But whether reverend Rapp learn'd this in Germany
     But whether such things do or do not weigh,
     But whether they escaped or no, lies hid
     But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds—
       But which I doubt extremely—thou sole prism
     But which is best, you know no more than I.
       But which neglect is hastening to destroy,

       But which to choose, I really hardly know;

     But women with their hearts on heaven knows what!

     By measuring 'the intensity of blue:'
     By merely wielding with poetic arm
     By mowing Christians down on every side,
       By naming streets: since men are so censorious,
     By nature, as in higher dames less hale
     By nature soft, his whole address held off

     By night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one

     By no means would produce the town's submission,
       By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,
     By one of these, the buffo of the party,
     By one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,
       By one three talents, for there were no less—
       By railing at the unknown and envied passion,
     By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,
     By rendering desperate those who had else repented.
       By saint, by sage, by preacher, and by poet,
       By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased
       By service with my military brothers

     By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd

     By that real epic unto all who have thought.

     By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber
     By the immortal wish and power to bless.
     By the infinities of agony,
     By their examples of true Christianity:
     By their own feelings hallow'd and united,
       By their possessors thrown into the shade:

       By the mere combination of a coterie;
       By the mere senses; and that which destroys

       By the North Pole,—they sought her cause of care,
       By theories quite practicable too;
     By the resistance of the chase they batter'd.
     By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.

     By which none were permitted to be neuter—
       By which such sirens can attract our great,
     By which such things are settled now-a-days.
       By which their power of mischief is increased,
       By which the more a haram is increased,

     Call'd 'Saviour of the Nations'—not yet saved,

       Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye—
       Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,

     Came over Juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!
     Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,
     Can every element our elements mar?
     Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.
       Can give us either pain or pleasure, who
     Can make the fool of which they made before,—
       Can never be described; we all have heard,
     Canonization for the self-same cause,
     Can paint,—'Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!'
     Can sneer at him who drew 'Achitophel'!
       Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
       Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?
     Can tender souls relate the rise and fall
     Can't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.

     Certes, but a preventative, and therefore
       Certes it was not body; he was well
       Certes it would have been but thrown away,
     Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;

     Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl'd;
     Changeable too, yet somehow idem semper;
       Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,
       Change grows too changeable, without being new:
     Change horses, making history change its tune,
     Changes in youth, to be surprised at any.

     Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;
       Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,
     Cheerful, but sometimes rather apt to whimper;

       Child to the care of guardians good and kind;

DEDICATION
     Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,
     Deeming the sage would be much mortified,
       Deem this a commentator's fantasy,
       Deepest attraction; for when to the view
     Deepest in those who long the most to die.
       Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide—
       Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;
       Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;
     Defended at a price extremely dear.
       Defying augury with that fond kiss;
           Degenerate into hands like mine?
     Delighted with their dinner and their host,
       Denying several little things he wanted:
       Denying the receipt of what it cost,
       Departed like the rest of their compeers,
     'Departure, for his country seat, to-day,
     Dependent on the public altogether;
     Depending more upon the historian's style
     Depends so much upon the gastric juice?
     'De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis.'
       Descending rather quickly the declivity,
     Descend—the fault is mine; this fatal shore
     Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
       Described—what 's strange—in words extremely few:
       Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?
       Description; and I won't reflect,—that is,
       Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,
       Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated
     Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
       Despatching single cruisers here and there,
     Despite her injured love and fiery pride;
     Despite of all their efforts and expedients,
     Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.
       Destruction's jaws into the devil's den;
     Detachment of three columns took its station,
       Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,
     Devour'd it, longing for the other too.
     Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
       Did not his deeds unriddle them each day—

     Diplomatists of rather wavering kings,
       Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,
       Direct your questions to my neighbour there;
     Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
       Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye

     Discuss'd (he hated beer yclept the 'small')
     Discuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,
       Discuss'd the world, and settled all the spheres;
       Discussion, which is neither here nor there:
       Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams
     Display'd some sylph-like figures in its maze;
       Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;
     Dissecting the whole inside of a question,
       Dissimulation always sets apart
     Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.
       Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,
     Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.

     Done thine, the present vouches for the past.
     Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd—why,
     Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
     Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,
       Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;
       Don Juan at his hands, and information
     Don Juan bade his valet pack his things
     Don Juan grew a very polish'd Russian—
     Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;
     Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;
     Don Juan, having done the best he could
     Don Juan, here permitted to emerge
     Don Juan in his feminine disguise,
     Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as
     Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,
       Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,
     Don Juan raised his little captive from
     Don Juan sat next 'an l'Espagnole'-
     Don Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,
     Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken
     Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
     Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,
       Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who
       Don Juan was delighted to secure
     Don Juan was presented, and his dress
     Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows

       Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,
     Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,—
     Doors there were many, through which, by the laws
     Do pray undo the bolt a little faster—

     Doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,

     Down her white neck long floating auburn curls
     Down to a very homely household savour.
     Down to the harp—because to music's charms
     Drains its first draught of lips:—but, as I said,
     Draperied her form with curious felicity!
     Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.
       Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,
       Dreadful as Dante's rhima, or this stanza;
     Dreading that climax of all human ills,
     Dream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,
     Drest to a Sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;
     Drest to receive so much good company.
       Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;
     Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess
     Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,
       Drew himself up to his full height again,
     Drew quiet consolation through its hint,
       Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,
     Droop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,
     Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),
       Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,—
     Dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.
     Dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,
       Dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,
     Dudu said nothing, but sat down beside
       Dudu was fond of kissing—which I 'm sure
     Dully past o'er the dinner of the day;
       Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,
       Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:
     During this inquisition, Julia's tongue
       Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,
       Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,
     Dyes with his morning light,—and would conceal
     Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
     Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;
     Each bevy with the merchant in his station:
     Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.
     Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;
     Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,

     (For little things upon my lord's estate
     Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,
       For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,—
     For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,
       For love, war, or ambition, which reward
       For making squares and streets anonymous;
       For malice still imputes some private end,
       For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.
       Form'd a whole which, irregular in parts,
     Form'd like an amphitheatre, each dwelling
     Form'd of two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.
     Form'd rather for instructing than delighting,
     For me appears a question far too nice,
     For me, for I would rather take my wine
     For me, I deem an absolute autocrat
     For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,
     For me, I leave the matter where I find it,
     For me, I sometimes think that life is death,
     For me on earth, except some years to hide
     For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,
     Form not the true temptation which allures
     For morals, marriage; and this question carried,
       Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;
       Forms the most difficult in punctuation.
     For mutes are generally used for that.
       For my part, I am but a mere spectator,
     For my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,
     For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,
       For my part, I pretend not to be Cato,
     For my part I say nothing—nothing—but
       For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,
     For native Spanish she had no great care,
     For naughty children, who would rather play
       For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:
       For neither of them could I ever find,
       For night was dosing ere they came to land.
     For none likes more to hear himself converse.'
     For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,
     For no one, save in very early youth,
       For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:
       For not the bless'd sherbet, sublimed with snow,
     For objects worthy of the sentiment.

       For reasons which I choose to keep apart.
       For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.
       For reputations he had little care;
       For rich men and their brides to lay their heads
     For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:

     For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,
     For several winters in the grand, grand monde.
     For she felt humbled—and humiliation
     For she had not even one—the worst of all.
       For she had seen the world and stood its test,
     For she seem'd agitated, flush'd, and frighten'd,
     For she, too, was as one who could avenge,
       For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all
       For she was not a sentimental mourner
     For shore it was, and gradually grew
       For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:
     For six hours bore they without intermission

       For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,
     For some few years his lot had been o'ercast
     For some had absent lovers, all had friends.

     For some time, till they came in nearer view.
     For some vivacity among the fair,
     For some were thinking of their home and friends,
     Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men.
     For soon or late Love is his own avenger.
       Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;
       For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;
     For speaking out so plainly in his song,
           For standing on the Persians' grave,
     For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek
       For such all women are at first no doubt.
       For such a shield, which leaves but little merit
       (For such exaggerations here and there I see)
       For such precedence upon such occasions
     For such sights, though the tale is half believed,
       For surely if we always could perceive
     For talk six times with the same single lady,
     For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,
     For that compression in its burning core;
       For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:
     For that same twining 'transport and security'

       For that 's the phrase that settles all things now,
       For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace

     For then they are very difficult to stop.

       For the old negro's confidence in creeping,
       For there are few things by mankind less brook'd,
     For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,
     For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.
     For there one learns—'t is not for me to boast,
     For there 's no saying what they will or may do.
     For there the Spanish family Moncada
     For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'
     For there were but three shirts between the two;

       For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;
       'For this effect defective comes by cause,'-
     For this first fault, and that on no condition
       For this great conqueror play'd the corporal—
     For this in silence I have suffer'd long
     For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
     For this superior yoke of human cattle.
       For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.
     For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,
     For those who knew not to resign or reign.
     For those whom favour or whom fortune swells,
     For through the South the custom still commands

       For want of facts would all be thrown away),
     For want of water, and their solid mess
     For war cuts up not only branch, but root.
     Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
     For we all know that English people are
     For weapons; but what Muse since Homer 's able

       For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,
           For what is left the poet here?
       For what is sometimes called poetic diction,
     For what is stealing young ones, few or many,
     For when his pious consort gave him stones
       For when they happen at a riper age,
     For which all Petersburgh is on the watch.
       For which he own'd a present appetite,
       For which men vainly decimate the throng,
     For which most friends reserve their sensibility.
     For which my sole excuse is—'t is my way;
       For which see Shakspeare's everblooming garden;—
     For which small thanks are still the market price,
       For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth
     For wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.
       For without hearts there is no home; and felt
     For woman's face was never form'd in vain
       For women shed and use them at their liking;
     For wordless woman, which is silent thunder.
       For yet they strove, although of no great use:
       For you have got that pleasure still to come:
       Found his own legs embargoed from mere walking.
       Found in one sigh the best interpreter
       Found life most tolerable after meals;
     Found only on the stage, and each more pain'd

       From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;
       From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare—
     From Haidee's glance than any graven letter.
       From heart to cheek is curb'd into a blush,
       From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;
       From his own brain's oppression while it reels.
     From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,
     From his translation; but had none admired,

       From ignorance of danger, which indues
     From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
       From marble, like Pygmalion's statue waking,
       From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)
     From much improvement with that virtuous plough
       From nature for the service of the gout—
       From off the marble, which had no defect.
     From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.
     From our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,
     From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain

     From out the commonest demands of nature?
     From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,

       From what some people say 't will be when done:
     From whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.
       From which away so fair and fast they bore.
     From which our modern morals rightly shrinking
     From which the secret nobody could rip:
     From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,
     From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,

       Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;

       Good God! I wonder what they would be at!
     Good government has left them, seems but cruel.
     Good hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,
       Good morrow—for the cock had crown, and light
     Good people all, of every degree,
     Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,

     Great Galileo was debarred the sun,
     Great happiness of the 'Nil Admirari.'
     'Great joy to London now!' says some great fool,
     Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first

     Gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;
     Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;
     Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.
     Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.
     Had all the pertinacity pride has,
     Had bagg'd this poacher upon Nature's manor.
       Had been as short in youth as indigestion
       Had been call'd 'Jemmy,' after the great bard;
       Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;
       Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,
     Had been the favourite of full many a mess
       Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
     Had bow'd themselves before th' imperial eyes,
     Had brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,
     Had Buonaparte won at Waterloo,
     Had Catherine and the sultan understood
     Had cost his enemies a long repentance,
       Had deck'd her out in all the hues of heaven:
       Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats
       Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,
     Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race
     Had English influence in the self-same sphere here;
       Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;
       Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,—
     Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.
     Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.
     Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.
       Had further sleep a further pleasure made;
       Had gather'd a large tear into its corner,
       Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;
       Had greater need to nerve themselves again
     Had he but been placed at a public school,
     Had held till now her soft and milky way;
       Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;
     'Had it but been for a stout cavalier
       Had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,
     Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,
     Had left all the accomplishments she taught her
       Had left their bodies; and what 's worse, alas!
     Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.
     Had lovers not some reason to regret
       Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
     Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.
       Had made more progress than for the last century.
     Had made them chaste;—they ravish'd very little.
       Had met a party towards the twilight's fall,
       Had mitigated part, though not the whole
       Had more of her existence, for in her
     Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er
     Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale
     Had not come up in time to cast an awe
     Had not one word to say of constancy.
     Had not so many ornaments to strike,
       Had often turn'd the art to some account:
       Had palisado'd in a way you 'd wonder
       Had perish'd in the field or by the wall:
     Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,
     Had raised an interest in her, which increased.
       Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;
     Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,
     Had scarr'd her brow, and left its crimson trace,
     Had seen the world—which is a curious sight,
       Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,
     Had sent them this for their deliverance.
     Had set some time, and night was on the ridge
     Had settled all; nor could he then presume
       Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:
     Had she but been a Christian, I 've a notion
     Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
     Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled—
       Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;
     Had sketches of love, tempest, travel, war—
     Had soil'd the current of her sinless years,
       Had something ready upon most occasions—
     Had still preserved his perpendicular.
     Had stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it.
       Had stopp'd this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,
     Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.
     Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god
     Had suffer'd more—his hardships were comparative
       Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,
       Had told his son to satisfy his craving
     Haidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,
     Haidee and Juan carpeted their feet
       Haidee and Juan their siesta took,
     Haidee and Juan thought not of the dead—
     Haidee and Juan were not married, but
       Haidee forgot the island was her sire's;
     Haidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;
       Haidee was Passion's child, born where the sun
       Hail'd a strange brig—Corpo di Caio Mario!
     Hail, Muse! et cetera.—We left Juan sleeping,
       Hail! Thamis, Hail! Upon thy verge it is
       Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;
     Half epileptical and half hysterical:—
       Half her attractions—probably from pity—
       Half letting in long shadows on the light,
     Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.
     Half-pay for life, make mankind worth destroying.
     Half-solved into these sodas or magnesias;
       Half virtues and whole vices being combined;
       Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,
       Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;
       Happier than they who still perceived their woes;
     Happy the nations of the moral North!
     Hard labour's an indifferent go-between;
     Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,
     Hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.
     Hard words, which stick in the soft Muses' gullets.
     Hark! how the roar increases!—no excuse
           Hark! rising to the ignoble call—
     Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,
       Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)
     Has been declared an act of inurbanity,
     Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.
     Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.
       Has feelings pure and polish'd as a gem,—
     Has generally no great crop to spare it, he
     Has given a sample from the vasty version
       Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;
       Has lately been the great Professor Kant.
     Has madness seized you? would that I had died
       Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.
     Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge.
       Has not the natural stays of strict old age;
       Has not yet given up the practice quite.
     Has quite the contrary effect on vice.
     Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,
       Has shown, I know not why they should displease
       Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,
       Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,
       Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;
     Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.
     Haste—haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet—
     Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it—
     Hate to the world and war with every nation
     Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,
       Hath got blue devils for his morning mirrors:
     Hath won the experience which is deem'd so weighty.
     Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;
     'Haud ignara loquor;' these are Nugae, 'quarum
     Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;
       Haustus' (And here the surgeon came and cupp'd him)
       Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
       Have always had a tendency to spare,—
     Have been obliged to slay a freeborn native
     Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,
     Have dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;
     Have felt that moment in its fullest power
       Have fill'd their papers with their comments various,
           Have found the fame your shores refuse;
     Have got a travell'd air, which speaks you one
     Have half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.
     'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,
       Have in their several arts or parts ascendance
     Have left undone the greatest—and mankind.
       Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
       Have much employ'd the muse of history's pen;
       Have not been troubled with them lately. Now
     Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,
       Have not exactly ascertain'd the Pole
       Have plainly made it out that four are three,
     Have princes who spur more than their postilions.
     Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.
     Have 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,
       Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;
     Have shaving too entail'd upon their chins,—
     Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.
     Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
     Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,
     Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?
       Have such a prescience, it should be no bar
       Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are
       Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,
       Have taken up at length with younger brothers:
       Have taken up to fill the following sermon,
     Have tied together commons, lords, and kings.
       Have voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.
       Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,
     Have you explored the limits of the coast,
     'Have you no friends?'—'I had—but, by God's blessing,
       Having been several days in great distress,
     Having been used to serve on horses' backs,
       Having no custom-house nor quarantine
       Having no equals, nothing which had e'er
     Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'
     Having no paper, for the want of better,
       Having withstood temptation in my youth,
     Having wound up with this sublime comparison,
     Hawk'd about at a discount, small or large;
            He abideth night and day.
       He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires
       He added modestly, when rebels rail'd),
     Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,
       He almost honour'd him for his docility;
     He also found that he had lost his dinner.
     He also had a quality uncommon
     He also had been busy seeing sights—
     He also stuff'd his money where he could
     He always is complaining of his lot,
       He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair—
     Heard,—and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum
       Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,
     He ask'd no further questions, and proceeded
     He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;
     He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,
     Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life
       Heaven help me! I 'm but little of a parson:
       'Heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here!'
     Heaven knows? But Adeline's malicious eyes
       Heaven knows how long—no doubt they never reckon'd;
     Heaven knows,—it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.
     Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,
            Heaven sain him, fair or foul!
     Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.
     Heaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,
       Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,
     He—being a man who seldom used a word
     He being paid to satirize or flatter,
     He bore these sneers against his near relations,
       He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw
     He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws
       He buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply
     He but requested to be bled to death:
     He caged in one huge hamper altogether.
     He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
       He cannot sink his tremors or his terrors;
     He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
     He chose from several animals he saw—
     He chose himself to point out what he thought
       He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,
       He climb'd to where the parapet appears;
            He comes—but not to grieve.
       He could not help the thing which he related:
       He could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,
           He counted them at break of day—
       Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,
       He danced without theatrical pretence,
       He deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,
     He deems it is his proper place to be;
     He deigned not to belie his soul in songs,
     He did not fall asleep just after dinner;
     He did not know (alas! how men will lie)
     He did not loathe the sire to laud the son,
       He did not take such studies for restraints;
     He did not think much on the matter, nor
     He died: and most unluckily, because,
     He died as born, a Catholic in faith,
     He died at fifty for a queen of forty;
       He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on
     He died, deserving well his country's tears,
     He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,
     He doubted not a few hours of reflection
       He drank six cups of coffee at the least,
     He dress'd; and like young people he was wont
       Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse.
     He enter'd in the house—his home no more,
     He enter'd in the house no more his home,
       He fear'd his neck to venture such a nag on,
     He fell, immortal in a bulletin.
       He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand
     He fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like
       He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,
       He felt like other plants called sensitive,
     He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
     He first inclined to think he had been mistaken,
     He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
       He flew into a passion, and in fact
            He flits on the bridal eve;
     He flitted to and fro a dancing light,
     He fought, but has not fed so well of late.
     He found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter'd
     He found, as people on most trials must,
       He found—but sought not. I have pledged my faith;
     He found himself alone, and friends retiring.
     He found himself extremely in the fashion,
     He found how much old Time had been a winner—
     He from the world had cut off a great man,
       He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.
     He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,
       He gave the different nations something national;
     He gave the word,—'Arrest or slay the Frank.'
     He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange
     He glanced like a personified Bolero;
     He gloried in the name of Englishman.
     He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,
       He had a kind of inclination, or
     He had also stood at times behind the throne—
     He had an English look; that is, was square
     He had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,
       He had a predilection for that tie;
     He had been hid—I don't pretend to say
     He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.
     He had been rather indisposed of late;
       He had behaved with courage and humanity—
       He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,—
     He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,
     He had his judge's joke for consolation.
     He had many friends who had many wives, and was
       He had no business to commit a sin,
     He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.
     He had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know.
     He had pronounced her name—but she forgot
     He had the art of drawing people out,
       He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,
     He had travell'd 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,
       He hated cruelty, as all men hate
     He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark
     He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,
     He heard repeated, Juan with a frown
     He hears—alas! no music of the spheres,
       He hers, until they end in broken gasps;
       He hew'd away, like doctors of theology
     He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure
       He is, nor whence he came—and little care;
     He is your only poet;—passion, pure
     He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
       He judged them proper to assail the works;
       He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,
       He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,
     He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.
     He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,
     He knew not why, arriving at this pass,
     He knew the world, and would not see depravity
       He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;
       Held out unto the hungry Israelites;
     He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,
     He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
     He led them onward, first through a low thicket
     He left his ship to be hove down next day,
     He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,
     He left to his vizier all state affairs,
     He lied with such a fervour of intention—
       He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
     He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;
     He liked to have a handsome paramour
     He liked to teach that which he had been taught,
     He likewise could be most things to all women,
     He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry
     He 'll answer all for better or for worse,
     He 'll find it rather difficult some day
     He look'd in almost all respects a maid,
       He look'd upon her, but gave no reply;
     He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,
       He loved the infant orphan he had saved,
       Help contradicting them, and every body,
     He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide
     He made no answer; but he took the city.
       He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it
     He may resume his amatory care
       He might—and brought them up with skill, in time
     He might be taught, by love and her together—
     He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,
     He motion'd them to stop at some small distance,
       He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,
     He moved some hundred miles off, for a station
     He must his laurels separately earn;
     He mutter'd (but the last was given aside)
       He naturally loved what he protected:
     Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,
       Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning—
     He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;—
     He neither brook'd nor claim'd superiority.
       He never would believe the city won
     He, on the other hand, if not in love,
     He owed to an old woman and his post.
     He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;
     He paused—and so will I; as doth a crew
     He paused, and took a survey up and down.
     He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
     He praised the present, and abused the past,
       He prated to the world of 'Pantisocracy;'
       He probably would have philosophised:
     He puzzled over what he found a new one,
     Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess
     He raised his whistle, as the word he said,
     Her anger, and beseech'd she 'd hear him through—
     Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,
     Her aspect was as usual, still—not stern—
       Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:
     Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night
     Her beauty also seem'd to form no clog
       Her beauty of that overpowering kind,
     Her black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,
     Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:
     (Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;
     Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)
     Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,
     Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,
     Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye
     Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,
     Her charming figure and romantic history
       Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
     Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,
     Her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,
       Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,
       Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);
     Her climacteric teased her like her teens;
     Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd
     Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:
     Her conduct had been perfectly correct,
     Herculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?
     Her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,
     Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
       Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
       Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;
       Her dress was very different from the Spanish,
     He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.
     He read an article the king attacking,
     Here and there studded with a seventy-four;
     'Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay
       Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
     He recognised an officer of rank.
     Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone
     Here ends this canto.—Need I sing, or say,
       (Here he call'd up a Polish orderly)
     Here he embark'd, and with a flowing sail
     (Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)
     Here-' he was interrupted by a knife,
     Here I might enter on a chaste description,
     Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,
     Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
       Here is the garden-key—Fly—fly—Adieu!
     Here laws are all inviolate; none lay
     Here Lolah interposed—'Mamma, you know
     Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take—
     Here pause we for the present—as even then
       Here peals the people's voice, nor can entomb it
     Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital
       Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;
     Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;
     Here taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'
     Here their conductor tapping at the wicket
     (Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).
     Here the twelfth Canto of our introduction
     Here they were interrupted by a humming
       He revell'd in his Ciceronian glory:
     Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
     Here War forgot his own destructive art
     Here was an honourable compromise,
     Here was no lack of innocent diversion
       Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber
     Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,
     Her eye dilated and her colour heighten'd.
     Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)
       Her eye in passing on his way to sale;
     Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged
     Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;
     Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.
     Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,
     Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,
     Her face declined and was unseen; her hair
     Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.
     Her fate had been to that of all her race;
     Her father's blood before her father's face
     Her father's face—but never stopp'd his hand.
     Her father's hospitality seem'd middling,
       Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;
     Her favourite science was the mathematical,
       Her features all the sweetness of the devil,
     Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop
     Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;
     Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;
     Her form had all the softness of her sex,
       Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;
     Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,
     Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.
       Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:
     Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
     Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,
       Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung
     Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
       Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain'd
       Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,
       Her Grace too had a sort of air rebuked,
     Her Grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,
     Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.
       Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;
       Her hair had silver only, bound to be
     Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
     Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel
     Her hair was dripping, and the very balls
       Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold
     Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes
     Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;
       Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes
     Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping
       Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;
     Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:
     Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,
       Her human day is kindled; full of power
       Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.
     Her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,
     Her inward grace for outward show, and makes
     Her late performance had been a dead set
       Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize
     Her letter out again, and read it through.)
     Her life to chance; but point me out some nook
     Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;
     Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,
       Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,
     Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
     Her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up—
       Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth
       Her master and his myrmidons, of whom
     Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
     Her mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,
       Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again
     Her neck alone was seen, but that was found
     Her next amusement was more fanciful;
       Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
     Her note, she don't forget the infant girl
     Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,
       Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is
       Heroes sometimes, though seldom—sages never;
       Her office was to keep aloof or smother
     Hero—for what is substance to a spirit?
     Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,
       Her only son with question or surmise:
     Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd
     Her overpowering presence made you feel
     Her own but served to set off every joke,
       Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush
       Her person if allow'd at large to run,
       Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.
     Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,
       Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,
     Her preference of a boy to men much bigger
     Her presence was as lofty as her state;
     Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,
     Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well—
     Her reason being weak, her passions strong,
       Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream
     Her resolutions were most truly great,
     Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
       Her second, to cut only his—acquaintance;
       Herself extremely on the inoculation
       Herself from out her present jeopardy,
       Herself in her sublimest attitude:
     Herself that her intentions were the best,
       Herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd
     Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.
       Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;
       Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:
       Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence
     Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.
     Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
       Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend
       Her son to Cadiz only to embark;
       Her speech out to her protege and friend,
       Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne
       Her state (it is the custom of her nation),
     Her stature tall—I hate a dumpy woman.
       Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):
       Her stomach 's not her peccant part; this tale
     Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,
       Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;
     Hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,
       Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,
     Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,
     Her talents were of the more silent class;
     Her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,
     Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;
     Her third was feminine enough to annul
       Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.
       Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;
     Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
     Her throne and power, and every thing beside.
     Her title was 'the Mother of the Maids.'
       Her toilet, which cost little, for she was
       He rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse
     He rush'd, while earth and air were sadly shaken
       Her very nod was not an inclination;
     Her very place of birth was but a spectre
     Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;
     Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,
     Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb—
       Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,
     Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,
     Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
     Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.
     Her young philosopher was grown already.
     Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid
     He 's a fine boy. The women may be sent
     He said,—and in the kindest Calmuck tone,—
       He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,
       He sate with feelings awkward to express
     He saw his white walls shining in the sun,
     He saw, however, at the closing session,
     He saw increasing on his father's heart,
     He saw some fellow captives, who appear'd
     He saw ten thousand living authors pass,
     He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
     He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,
     He scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource
     He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,
     He seem'd to sleep,—for you could scarcely tell
       He seem'd unconscious of all passing there,
             He served—but served Polycrates—
     'He shall if that he dare.' Here Juan bow'd
       He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
     He shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise
     He show'd himself as kind as mortal can.
     He show'd them how to mount a ladder (which
     He show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.
       He shows more appetite for words than war.
     He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers
       He shut his door, and after having read
     He sigh'd;—the next resource is the full moon,
     He slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said
       He sometimes thought 't was only their 'Salam,'
       He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd
     He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
       He started; and perceiving smiles around
       He started, and said, 'Yes—no—rather—yes.'
     He still preferr'd his own neck to another's.
            He still retains his sway,
     He still was in the boat and had but dozed,
     He stood—how long he knew not, but it seem'd
     He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
     He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
     He stood like Atlas, with a world of words
       He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.
     He stopp'd.—What singular emotions fill
       He strips from man that mantle (far more dear
     He studied steadily, and grew apace,
       He stumbled on, to try if he could find
     He suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,
          He sweeps along in his dusky pall,
     He 's wrong—unless man were a pig, indeed,
     He tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,
     He that reserves his laurels for posterity
     He there builds up a formidable dyke
     He thought about himself, and the whole earth
     He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,
     He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright
     He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
     He took to regularly peopling Earth,
     He turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,
       He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,
     He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand
       He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise—
       He varied with some skill his adulations;
     He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.
            He walks from hall to hall.
     He was a bachelor, which is a matter
       He was above the vulgar by his mien;
     He was a cold, good, honourable man,
     He was a Greek, and on his isle had built
     He was a jolly fellow, and could crack
       He was all things to all men, and dispensed
     He was a man of a strange temperament,
     He was a man who had seen many changes,
     He was a mortal of the careless kind,
     He was as good a sovereign of the sort
     He was as independent—ay, much more—
     He was 'free to confess' (whence comes this phrase?
     He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast
       He was in love,—as you would be, no doubt,
     He was not all alone: around him grew
       He was not yet quite old enough to prove
     He was now growing up like a green tree, able
     He was so great a loss to good society.
       He was to travel; and though Inez grieved
       He was well lodged, but only wonder'd how
     He was what Erin calls, in her sublime
     He watch'd it wistfully, until away
     He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,
     He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers
     He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,
     He who doubts all things nothing can deny:
     He who has nought to gain can have small art: he
       He who hath proved war, storm, or woman's rage,
     He whose whole life has been assault and battery,
     He who sleeps best may be the most content.
     He will forgive himself;—if not, I must.
     He will forgive us—yes—it must be—yes.
       He wish'd that land he never might see more;
     He wishes for 'a boat' to sail the deeps—
       He with the beardless chin and garments torn?'
     He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,
     He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,
     He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.
     He won them well, and may he wear them long!
     He would find others who would fain be rid so
     He would have hospitably cured the stranger,
     He would have written sonnets all his life?
     He would not join them in a single sally.
     He would not justify what he had done,
     He would not tread a factious path to praise,
     He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,
     He wrote to Spain:—and all his near relations,
     Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,
     High and inscrutable the old man stood,
     High barrows, without marble or a name,
       High dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,
       High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:
     High in high circles, gentle in her own,
       High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;
     Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
       Him borne into the house and up the stair,
     Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see
       Himself a favourite, ventured to address
     Himself and Juan in their mutual stations
     Himself at length within the leafy nooks
       Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,
     Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?
       Himself in at the age when all grow good;
       Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:
       Him up to learn his catechism alone,
     Him? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown—
     Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell
     Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways
       Hinted the vast advantages which they
     Hinting that soul and body on the whole
     Hints from the independent heart or head
       Hint that some six or seven good years ago
     Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.
     His afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons,
       His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,
     His answers with a very graceful bow,
     His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew
     His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;
     His beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,
     His bell-mouth'd goblet makes me feel quite Danish
     His berth a little damp, and him afraid.
       His best to obey in what he had been task'd;
       His bills in, and however we may storm,
     His blood less noble than such blood should be;
     His blood was running on the very floor
     His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
     His bosom,—for he never had a sister:
     His bow converted into a cock'd hat;
       His brain about the action of the sky;
     His breath,—he from his swelling throat untied
     His brow, as if in act to butt, and then
     His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.
     His cap and head, which proves the head to be
       His cause by leaning much from might to right:
       His chamber door wide open—and went forth
     His classic studies made a little puzzle,
       His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,
     His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,
     'His country's pride,' he came down to the country.
     His country's wrongs and his despair to save her
     His curls fell negligently o'er his front,
       His daily council upon ways and means
     His daily task had kept his fancy cool,
       His daughter—had not sent before to advise
       His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,
     His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
       His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;
     His duties warlike, loving or official,
     His empire also was without a bound:
       His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam
     His eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,
     His eyes were open, and (as was before
     His fame too,—for he had that kind of fame
     His father's name was Jose—Don, of course,—
       His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,
       (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)
     His feelings from all milk of human kindness,
     His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,
     His figure, and the splendour of his dress,
     His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:
     His first—perhaps his last—farewell of Spain.
     His five brave boys no less the foe defied;
          His form you may trace, but not his face,
     His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,
       His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,
       His garden trees all shadowy and green;
       His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:
     His garments only a slight murmur made;
     His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
       His glory might half equal his estate.
     His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup
       His Grace was an enduring, married man,
     His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!
       His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,
       His headache being increased by every billow;
     His head, until the ceremony ended.
       His head upon his elbow, and he saw
     His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)
       His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng
     His Highness cast around his great black eyes,
       His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,
     His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,—
     His Highness was a man of solemn port,
     His holy temples in the lands which bred
       His home deserted for the lonely wood,
       His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunderstroke;
     His house was sold, his servants sent away,
     His inexperience moved her gentle ruth,
       His jest alike in face of friend or foe,
     His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;
       His journey, we 've so many tours of late:
     His knights with, lotting others' properties
     His lady—mother, mathematical,
       His last award, will have the long grass grow
       His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;
       His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
       His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,
     His little captive gain'd him some applause
     (His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,
     His majesty saluted his fourth spouse
       His majesty was always so polite
       His manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;
     His manner was perhaps the more seductive,
     His man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,
     His maxims, which to martial comprehension
       His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
     His morns he pass'd in business—which, dissected,
       His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,
     His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,
     His mother was a learned lady, famed
     His muse made increment of any thing,
     His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,
     His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw
       His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight
     His only shrine of feelings undefiled.
     His orders, also to receive his pensions,
       His other arm forth. Wonder upon wonder!
     His other maxim, 'Noscitur a sociis,'
       His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,
     His own internal ghost began to awaken
       His own remonstrance further he well knew
       His own shall roll before you like a ball!'
       His own well in; so well, ere you could look,
     His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
       His parts of speech; and in the strange displays
       His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed
     His peace was making, but before he ventured
       His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;
     His pockets first and then his body riddled.
     His polar star being one which rather ranges,
     His port lay on the other side o' the isle.
     His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:
       His predecessors in the Colchian days;
     His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians
       His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved
       His prisoners, dividing them like chapters
     His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,
       His qualities (with them) into sublime:
     His question, much too merry to divine
     His readiness to feel his pulse and tell
     His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,
     His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
       His second son was levell'd by a shot;
       His self-communion with his own high soul,
     His services. He kiss'd hands the next day,
       His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;
       His singing I no further trust can place in:
       (His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):
     His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,
       His smile, requested one of them to tell
     His sober head, majestically tame,
     His sons were kept in prison, till they grew
       His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,
       His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)
     His Spanish friends for those in Italy.
     His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
       His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,
       His spirits, and without more explanation
       His station, generation, even his nation,
       His steady application as a dancer,
       His stern philosophy; but gently stroking
     His strain display'd some feeling—right or wrong;
     His stubborn valour was no future shield.
     His subjects by his gracious acceptation)
       His suffocation by that pretty pair;
     His suite consisted of three servants and
     His sympathy for rank, by the same token,
     His tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,
     His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea
       His temper not being under great command,
       His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,
     His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd
       His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:
       His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;
       His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:
     Historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put
     History can only take things in the gross;
       His travels to the capital apace;—
     His turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,
     His verses rarely wanted their due feet;
       His very cellars might be kings' abodes;
     His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied
     His vessel having need of some repairs,
       His vice—for he was of a kindling nation—
     His way to—where he knew not—single handed;
       His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,
       His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver
     His wondrous journey to some foreign court,
     His word had the same value as another's.
     His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
     His youth and constitution bore him through,
     His youth and features favour'd the disguise,
       His youth was not the chastest that might be,
     Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:
       Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss
       Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,
       Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,
       Honour was more before their names than after;
     Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.

     I 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,
     I 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just
       I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan—
       I 'll write poetical commandments, which

     It is observed that ladies are litigious
       (It is the country's custom), but in vain;
       It is the sable friar as before,
     It is to speculate on handsome faces,
     It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:
     It laughs not—there is now no fleshy bar

     It makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,
     It may be easily supposed, while this
     It may be, more than either—not unholy
     It may seem strange to find his manners bland;
       It mends their morals, never mind the pain:
     It might be seen, with diligence was sought,
       It might be that her silence sprang alone
       It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;
     It occupies me to turn back regards
     It open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven
     It open'd with a most infernal creak,
       I touch a single leaf where he is warden;—
     It palls—at least it did so upon me,
     It pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer
     It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,
     I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest—
     Its bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty
       Its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;
     It seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,
     It seem'd as though they came upon a shrine,
     It seem'd, however, but to open on
     It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,
       It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:
     It seems the work of times before the line
     It seems when this allotment was made out,
       Itself, and show'd a feverish disposition;
       Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
       Itself to apathy, for we must steep
     Itself with beauty's frail inanity,
     Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.
       Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;
     Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh
     Its glory, through all ages shining sunny,
     Its inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin.
       Its kind attentions to their proper pale,
     Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,
     Its motive for that charity we owe
     It sooner for the soul of me, and class
     It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected
     Its outlet dash'd into a deep cascade,
       Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,
     Its power unconsciously full many a time,—
     Its quantity is but condensed to quality.
       Its sanguinary way good—then another;
     Its sessions form our only almanack.
     Its shriller echoes—like an infant made
     Its snow through all;—her soft lips lie apart,
       Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye
     It stands some eighty versts from the high sea,
     It stood embosom'd in a happy valley,
       Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite—
       It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
     Its very courage stagnates to a vice.
     Its votaries, like innocence relying
     Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,
       Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,
     It teaches—Heaven knows only what it teaches,
     It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,
       It touched no soul nor body, but the wall,
       It trembled as magnetic needles do,
     It was a moment of that awful kind—
     It was as if their little looks could poison
     It was a spacious chamber (Oda is
       It was a trying moment that which found him

     It was indeed a wide extensive building
     It was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd

     It was such pleasure to behold him, such

     It were much better to have both than neither.

     It would have been more wise to save their victual.
     It would not be idolatry to kneel.

     I 've also seen some female friends ( 't is odd,
     I 've also seen some wives (not to forget

     I 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate
     I 've done to find the same throughout life's journey,
     I 've done with my tirade. The world was gone;
     I 've got new mythological machinery,
     'I 've heard of stories of a cock and bull;
       I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl
     I 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,
     I 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd
     I 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.
       I 've known them court an heiress for their lover.
     I 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,
       I 've not begun what we have to go through.
     I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.
     I 've rarely seen the man they did not fret.
     I 've said all I know of a name that fills
     I 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite
       I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late
     I 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,
     I 've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,
     I 've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,

     I wish he would explain his explanation.
       I wish indeed they had not had occasion,
     I wish it never led to something worse.
       I wish she had: his book 's the eleventh commandment,

     I wish the case could come before a jury here.
       I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,
     I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,
     I wish they 'd state how many they have gain'd.
     I wish they knew the life of a young noble.
     I wish to be perspicuous; and the black,
     I wish to do as much by poesy.

       Joanna Southcote's Shiloh, and her sect,
     John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,
     John Keats, who was kill'd off by one critique,
     Johnson retired a little, just to rally
     Johnson said: 'Juan, we 've no time to lose;
     Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy
       Johnson, who really loved him in his way,
     Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,
     Joy of its alchymy, and to repeat
       Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,
       Juan admired these highways of free millions;
     Juan a moment, as this pair so small
     Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,
     Juan and Haidee gazed upon each other
     Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,
     Juan and Johnson join'd a certain corps,
       Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,
     Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;
     Juan, as an inveterate patrician,
       Juan being then grown up to man's estate
     Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides
     Juan consented to march on through thunder,
     Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
     Juan demurr'd at this first notice to
     Juan embark'd—the ship got under way,
     Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed
       Juan from the apartment: with a sign
     Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate—
     Juan got into the long-boat, and there
       Juan had not betray'd himself; in fact
     Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,
     Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,
     Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,—
     Juan—in this respect, at least, like saints—
     Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,
     Juan knew nought of such a character—
     Juan knew several languages—as well
     Juan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;—
       Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;
     Juanna should be taken from her, and
       'Juanna.'—Well, a pretty name enough.
     Juan presented in the proper place,
     Juan put forth one arm. Eternal powers!
     Juan rejoin'd—'She was a Catholic,
       Juan replied: 'At least I will endure
       Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'
     Juan replied, with all becoming deference,
       Juan retired,—and so will I, until
     Juan's companion was a Romagnole,
     Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
       Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,
     Juan's was good; and might have been still better,
     Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,
     Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught
     Juan, though careless, young, and magnifique,
       Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;
     Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,
     Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew
     Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,
       Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;
     Juan was juvenile, and thus was full,
     Juan was moved; he had made up his mind
     Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,
     Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint
     Juan was something she could not divine,
     Juan was taught from out the best edition,
       Juan was told about their curious case;
     Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper
     Juan, who did not stand in the predicament
     Juan, who did not understand a word
       Juan, who for an instant had been moved
     Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,
     Juan, who had no shield to snatch, and was
     Juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed
     Juan, whose was a delicate commission,
     Juan, who was a little superficial,
     Juan would question further, but she press'd
     Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,
     Judges in very formidable ermine
       Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;
     Judging by what they take, and what they pay.
     Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
     Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,
     Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,—
     Julia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)—
     Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
       Julia was sent into a convent: she
     Julia was—yet I never could see why—
       Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:
       Just as a friar may accuse his vow,
       Just as a languid smile began to flatter
     Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,—
       Just as he really promised something great,
     Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,
     Just as I feel the 'Improvvisatore.'
       Just as I make my mind up everyday
     Just as Koutousow's most 'forlorn' of 'hopes'
     Just as my great coat was about me cast,
     Just as old age is creeping on apace,
       Just as one views a horse to guess his price;
     Just as the day began to wane and darken,
     Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
     Just as you 'd break a sucking salamander
       Just at the close of the first bridal year,
       Just at the proper time; and though a lad,
     Just at the very time when he least broods
     Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,
     Just at this instant, while their eyes were fix'd
       Just for the present; and in his lull'd head
     Just in the very crisis she should not.
     Just in the way we very often see.
     Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
     Just named, these palisades were primly set:
     Just now a black old neutral personage
     Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.
     Just now,—but by and by the Truth will show 'em
     Just now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle
     Just now there was no peril of temptation;
     Just now yours were cut out in different sections:
     Just ponder what a pious pastime war is.
       Just then; as they are rather numerous found,
     Just to console sad glory for being glorious;
     Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.
     Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,
     Katinka ask'd her also whence she came—
     Katinka, too; and with a gentle bow
       Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,
       (Keeping the due proportions still in sight)
     Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.
       Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.'
       Kept above water, with an oar for mast,
     Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.
     Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,
     Kept the place open for their emulation.
     Kept this herself, and gave her son another.
       Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.
     Kept up; and above all, the where and how
     Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.
     Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,
     Kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.
     Kindling Religion till she throws down her gage,
       Kindness, destroys what little we had got:
       Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,
       Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,
       Kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty,
     'Kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse—
       Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,
       Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,
       Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)
     Knew that he had a rider on his back.
       Knew when and how 'to cut and come again,'
     Knock'd to inform him it was time to dress.
       Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,
     Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),
       Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads
     Knowing they must be settled by the laws.
       Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now,
       Knowledge of matters—but no matter what—
       Know little more of love than what is sung
     Known but to them, at least appearing such
       Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript
     Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.
     Know very clearly—or at least lie still.

     Koutousow, he who afterward beat back
     'La Belle Alliance' of dunces down at zero,

     Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
       Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,

       Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'-
     Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,
     Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,
       Leaving as ladders their heap'd carcasses,
     Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
     Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead
     Leaving my people to proceed alone,
     Leaving such to the literary rabble:

     Left him, at last, the sole of many masters
     Left him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave

     Left it before he had been treated very ill;

       Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;

     Less like a young wife than an aged sister.
     Less on a convent than a coronet.

     Life has nought like it. God is love, they say,
     Life knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,—
       'Life 's a poor player,'—then 'play out the play,
     Life seems the smallest portion of existence;
     Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crown'd
     Life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier

     Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
       Light to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun
     Like a backgammon board the place was dotted
     Like a bob-major from a village steeple.
     Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
       Like Addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,
     Like a good ship entangled among ice,
       Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,
       Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd
       Like all who give and eke receive it gratis,
     Like a meek tradesman when, approaching palely,
       Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.
     Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad
       Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;
     Like 'Anthony's by Caesar,' by the few
     Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,
     Like Archimedes, I leave earth as 't was.

       Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample
       Like Burns (whom Doctor Currie well describes);
     Like Charlemagne's—and all such peers in look
     Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:
     Like chastest wives from constant husbands' sides
     Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling
     Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.
     Like Cromwell's pranks;—but although truth exacts
       Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a giant;
       Like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he
     Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'
     Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.
     Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her.
       Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,
       Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,
       Like flowers well water'd after a long drouth.
     Like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye,
     Like garden gods—and not so decent either.
     Like garlic, howsoever she extends
     Like gold as in comparison to dross,
     Like hail, to make a bloody diuretic.
       Like harness'd meteors; then along the floor
     Like Holbein's 'Dance of Death'—but 't is the same);—
     Like human beings during civil war.
     Like Lucifer when hurl'd from heaven for sinning;
       (Like lucus from no light); through prospects named
     Like magnetism, or devilism, or what
     Like man's vain glory, and his vainer troubles.
     Like many people everybody knows,
       Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,
       Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;
       Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in
       Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er
       Like most in the belief in which they 're bred,
     Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.
       Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;
       Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;
     Like one life could not hold, nor death destroy.
     Like one who grapples with his enemy,
     Like other angry ladies of her nation,—

       Like poplars, with good principles for roots;
       Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;
     Like Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.
     Like Russians rushing from hot baths to snows
       Like Samuel from the grave to freeze once more
       Like Shakspeare's stealing deer, Lord Bacon's bribes;
     Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,
     Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
       Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind
       Like small stars through the milky way apparent;
       Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,
     Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,

     Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.
       Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,
       Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;
       Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,
     Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.
     Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.
     Like Titus' youth, and Caesar's earliest acts;
     Like to a lighted alabaster vase;—
     Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,
     Like to her father's features, till each trace—
       Like to the champion in the fisty ring,
     Like to the notions we now entertain
       (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;
       Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
     Like virtue; and the absence of pretension
       Like water-lilies floating down a rill—

       Lockless—so pliable from the pure gold
     Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight
     Lolah demanded the new damsel's name—

     Look'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,
     Look'd grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,
       Look'd into his for love, where none replies:
       Look'd more adapted to be put to bed,
       Look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust
     Look like the monsters of a new museum?
       Look living in the moon; and as you turn
       Look up to thine and to thy Son's above!
       Look where you please—we 've nothing, sir, to hide;
     Look yes last night, and yet say no to-day?

     Love bears within its breast the very germ
     Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,
     Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,
       Love is so very timid when 't is new:
       (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):
     Love lingers still, although 't were late to wive;
     Lovely as those which ripen'd Eden's fruit;
     Lovely seem'd any object that should sweep
     Love may exist with marriage, and should ever,
     Love or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;
     'Love rules the camp, the court, the grove,'—'for love
     Love 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold
     Love 's riotous, but marriage should have quiet,
     Love 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;
       Love, that great opener of the heart and all
     Love, then, but love within its proper limits,
       Love, though good always, is not quite so good),
     Love (though she had a cursed taste for war,
     Love, war, a tempest—surely there 's variety;

     Lull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue
       Lurk'd Christianity; which sometimes barters
     Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,

       Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:—
     Made epigrams occasionally too
       Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat
     Made her a beautiful embodied storm.
     Made his last illness, when, all worn and wan,
     Made ice seem paradise, and winter sunny.
       Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,
     Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.
            Made Norman Church his prey,
       Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;
     Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,

     Made up upon an amatory pattern,

       March, my Muse! If you cannot fly, yet flutter;
     Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!
     Mark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!

       May average on the whole with parturition.
     May be the baits for gentlemen or lords
       May be the hoarder's principle of action,
     May choose between the headache and the heartache.
       May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,
       May drop in without cards, and take their station
     May find himself within that isle of riches
     May have another name for half we scan
     May have suggested that this single one
           May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;

       May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;
     May not think much of London's first appearance—
       May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt
       May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,
       May retrograde a little in the dance
     May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.
     May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate
     May sit like that of Nessus, and recall
     May still expatiate freely, as will I,
     May teach us better to behave when masters.'
       May the rose call back its true colour soon!
       May the seraglio do to set his face in,
     May turn his name up, as a rare deposit.
     May win perhaps a riband at the breast!

     Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,
     Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,

     Meantime, read all the national debt-sinkers,
     Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate
     Meantime the current, with a rising gale,
     Meantime the education they went through
     Meantime the lady and her lover sate

     Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;
     Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;
     Men have all these resources, we but one,
     Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.
       Men made the manners; manners now make men—
       Men really know not what good water 's worth;

     More joy than from all future pride or praise,
       More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew—
     More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)
       More modern buildings and those built of yore,
     More Muse-like—like to Cytherea's shell.
     Moreover I 've remark'd (and I was once
     More quiet, when our moon 's no more at full,
       More tender, as we every day behold,
     More than can be believed, or even thought,
     More than for those of nightingales or doves.
     More than I have myself of what could make

       More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean
     More than the head of the inveterate foe,
     More than within the bosom of a nun:

     Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.
     Most orators, but very few financiers,
     Most people as it plays along the arras.

     Must make a present to his sire in law.
     Must not have latterly been quite worn out,
       Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.
     Must share it,—Happiness was born a twin.
     Must steer with care through all that glittering sea
     Must still obey the high—which is their handle,
     Must the event decide between the two?
             Must we but blush?—Our fathers bled.

     Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,
     Napoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should
     Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
       Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays
     Nations, she liked man as an individual.
       Nature had written 'gentleman.' He said
     Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,
     Nay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both
       Nay, married dames will now and then discover
     'Nay,' quoth the maid, 'the Sultan's self shan't carry me,
       'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;
     Need not seem very wonderful, for vice
     Ne'er compass'd, nor less mortal chisel wrought.
       Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
     Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
     Neither—but a good, plain, old, temperate man,
       Neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,
       Neither can show quite how they would be loved.
     Nelson was once Britannia's god of war,
       Nem. con. amongst the women, which I grieve
       Never could she survive that common loss;
     Never had mortal man such opportunity,
     Never to say a word about them more—
     New batteries were erected, and was held
       New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,
     New buildings of correctest conformation,
     New characters; the episodes are three:
       New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;'
     New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.
     New thoughts of life, for it seem'd full of soul—
     Newton (that proverb of the mind), alas!
       New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise
     Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.
     Next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;
     Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.
     Next, that 'he never judged from what appear'd,
     Next they—he being naked, save a tatter'd
     Next to the making matches for herself,
     Next with a virgin zone he was equipp'd,
     Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,
     Night fell: this seem'd a better omen still.
       Nimrods, whose canvass scarce contain'd the steed;
     Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,
     Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still
     Nine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,
       No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:
       Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,
       No; but you have heard—I understand—be dumb!
       No Caesar, but a fine young lad, who fought
     No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
     No Christian knoll to table, saw no line
       No common language; and besides, in time
     No courtier could, and scarcely woman can
       No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;
       Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.
     No doubt a consolation to his dust.
     No doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,
     No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,
     No doubt his sensibilities were less.
     No doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court
     No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven
       No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
     No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:
     No doubt I should be told that black is fair.
       No doubt, less of her language than her look:
     No doubt the secret influence of the sex
       No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;
     No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
     No doubt we weep for those the heart endears—
     No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,
     Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,
     'No, faith.'—'What then?'—'I ran away from her.'
       No fashion made them apes of her distortions;
     No friend like to a woman earth discovers,
     No harm unto a right legitimate head:
     No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.
       No hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;
       No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,
       No less a friend to government—he held,
       No less a victim to the bolt and bar.
     No less delighted to employ his leisure;
     No less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd.
     No lips e'er left their transitory trace;
       No longer ready ears and short-hand pens
     No marvel then he was a favourite;
       No matter how or why, the passport shrouds
     No matter how or why the thing befell,
     No matter; we should ne'er too much enquire,
       No matter what—it was not that they sought;
     No matter what poor souls might be undone.
     No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.
     (No matter which) turn politician stupider,

     No more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,
     No more—no more—Oh! never more, my heart,
     No more—no more—Oh! never more on me
     No more of them, than they of her, I trow.
       No more of this, then,—let us pray!' We have
     No more on this—the dinner-bell hath rung,
     No more to be beheld but in such visions—
     None but her own and father's grave is there,
       None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
     None can say that this was not good advice,
     'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa
     None in particular had sought or plann'd it,
     None, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,
     None than themselves could boast a longer line,

       Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;
       Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed

     Nor worn the motley mantle of a poet,
     Nor would be thus:—the difference in them
     Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,
     Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;

     Not having of my own domestic cares.
     Nothing affected, studied, or constructive

     Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,
       Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,
       Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.
       Of change; and how should this be otherwise?
     Of character, in those at least who have got any.
       Of charms that should or should not be admired.
     Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,

     Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,
     Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;

       Of course the others could not but express
     Of course these groups were scatter'd here and there,
     Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,

       Of eating, with another act or two,
     Of echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,
     Of 'elegant' et caetera, in fresh batches—
     Of eloquence in piety and prose—
     Of empires heave but like some passing waves.
     Of endless torments and perpetual motion.
       Of English, save their shibboleth, 'God damn!'
     Of epic Love's beginning, end, and middle.
     Of Eros: but though thou hast play'd us many tricks,
     Of every depotism in every nation.
     Of every monarch, till they are consign'd

       Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;
     Of faithful pairs (I needs must rhyme with dove,
       Of fame or profit when the world grows weary.
       Of fashion,—say what streams now fill those channels?
     Of fault or temper ruin'd the connection
       Of favouritism, but not yet in the blush;
       Off each attack, when people are in quest
     Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.
     Of feeling: for however habit sears
     Of feeling for some kindness done, when power
     Offence, we know not; probably it perch'd
       Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
       Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,
     Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,
       Of fitting out her favourites, conferr'd
     Of flatterers, though she deem'd he had more sense
     Of folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,
     Of food I think with Philip's son, or rather
       Of forms and features; it would strike you blind
     Of fortresses, but fighting where it pleases
     Of forty thousand who had mann'd the wall,
       Off—or upon the hustings—some slight such
     Of frail humanity—must make us selfish,
       Of freedom shall complete their education.
     Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,
     Of friendship which you may accept or pass,

     Off, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.
       Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where
       Of gentle dames, among whose recreations
       Of gentle feminine delight, and shown
       Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,
     Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.
     Of getting into heaven the shortest way;
     Of getting on himself, and finding stations
       Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;
       Of glory, and all that immortal stuff
       Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,
     Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
       Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving
     Of good advice—and two or three of credit.
       Of good examples; pity that so few by
     Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice
     Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:
     Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.
       Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts.'
       Of half-past six—perhaps still nearer seven—
     Of half voluptuousness and half command.
     Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he
     Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.
       Of health but flicker'd with a faint reflection
     Of hell-fire—all prepared for people giving
     Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!
       Of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk
       Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,
     Of her deep purple robe, and speaking low,
     Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;
     Of her first fruit; but how he falls and rises
       Of heroism, and took his place with solemn
       Of highest caste—the Brahmins of the ton.
       Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,
     Of him who, in the language of his station,
     Of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;
     Of his attractions marr'd the fair perspective,
     Of his departure had been sent him by
     Of his drill'd nymphs, but like a gentleman.
       Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,
       Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition
       Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one
       Of his new system to perplex the sages.
     Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.
       Of his opinion, when I see cast down
     Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
       Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had
     Of his own country;—seldom since that day
       Of his own nature, and the various arts,
     Of his position I can give no notion:
       Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low
       Of his whole army, which so much abounded
     Of homicide, but there was no solidity
     Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.
     Of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.
       Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,
       Of human frailty, folly, also crime,
     Of human hearts, than all the long array
     Of human nature's agonising voice!
       Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!
     Of human years, that half-way house, that rude
       Of hunting—for the sagest youth is frail;
       Of idle apprehensions, which like wind
     Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.
       Of import both to virgin and to bride,
     Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,—
     Of inspiration gather'd from distress,
       Of intellect expanded on two courses;
     Of its disease; he did the best he could
       Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:
       Of Juan's merits and his situation,
       Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.
     Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,
       Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,
       Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead
       Of ladies of all countries at the will
       Of ladies who can not have their own way;
     Of late the penalty of such success,
     Of late years, to dispense with Cocker's rigours,
       Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;
       Of life, and in an honester vocation
     Of life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,
     Of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty
       Of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:
       Of light to save the venerably chaste:
     Of living in their insular abode.
     Of Lolah—though her couch is not so large.'
       Of Londonderry drawling against time,
     Of looking in the bed as well as under.
       Of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,
       Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,
     Of love! when I forget you, may I fail
       Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,
     Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,
     Of man; it is—I really scarce know what;
       Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
     Of many charms in her as natural
     Of marriage (which might form a painter's fame,
     Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted
     Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping
     Of melancholy merriment, to quote
       Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;
     Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.
     Of merit, and complaint of present days
       Of metaphysics; others are content
       Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,
       Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game
       Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,
     Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp:—
       Of modesty declined the assistance proffer'd:
     Of monitors adapted to recall,
     Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
       Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along—
     Of murder'd women, who had found their way
       Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend
       Of nations, and had never bent or bow'd
       Of nations freed, and the world overjoy'd,
     Of Nature, or the man of Ross run wild.
     Of nature's oracle—first love,—that all
       Of nicety, where a fact is to be gain'd),—
     Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping
     Of no great promise for poetic pages.
       Of ocean?—No, of air; and then he makes
       Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,

     Of officers a third fell on the spot,
       Of one another's minds at last have grown
     Of one good man, with stately march and slow,
       Of one of the most circulating scandals
     Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.
       Of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,'
       Of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,
     O, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!
     O for a forty-parson power to chant
     O for a glass of max! We 've miss'd our booty;
     Of oriental plants, 'et cetera,'
     Of orphans paints at once a parish school,
     Of others' feeling; but they are such liars,
     Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.
     Of others with her own opinions, stated—
     Of our artillery and his own: 't is said
       Of ours, although they propagate more broadly.
     Of our sensations! What a curious way
     Of pantomime;—he danced, I say, right well,
       Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,
       Of paying debts, which creditors regret)
     Of payment ere the honey-moon's last kisses
     Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.
     Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises
       Of physics, bodies whether short or tall
     Of pillowing its head on a pincushion,
     Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss
     Of pleasure and of pain—even while I kiss
     Of plight and promises to be a spouse,
       Of poets and romancers:—You 're a bore,
     Of poets who come down to us through distance
       Of politicians and their double front,
     Of poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,
       Of Pope and Dryden, are we come to this?
     Of porcelain held in the fetter'd flowers,
     Of present life a good deal more than we.'
       Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes
     Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.
     Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,
       Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,
       Of reformation, ere the year run out,
     Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'
     Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye
       Of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,
     Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.
       Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,
       Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,
       Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,
       Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise
     Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,
       Of sense and song above your graves may hiss—
       Of sentimental friendship, there were three,
     Of sentiment; and he she most adored
     Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.
       Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
       Of 'single blessedness,' and thought it good
     Of single gentlemen who would be double.
       Of slumber, ere they shook her,—so they say
     Of Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,
       Of sober reason wheresoe'er it moves,
       Of solitude; Health shrank not from him—for
     Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke
     Of some strong swimmer in his agony.
       Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
     Of Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:
       Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not.
       Of such a sentimental situation?
       Of such a spirit in these halls of old,
     Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,
       Of such a throne as is the proudest station,
       Of such discussion. She was there a guest;
     Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast
       Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.
       Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,
     Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,
       Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,
       Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;
       Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what
     Of that odd string of words, all in a row,
       Of that same Babel, or because they won't
     Of that same tune, when people hum it long)—
     Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.
       Of the apartment—and appear'd quite new;
     Of the arm'd river, while with straggling light
       Of the assault, and all the camp was in
       Of the best class, and better than her class,—
     Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow
       Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,
       Of the continuance of the gale: to run
       Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,
       Of the good company, can win a corner,
     Of the good feudal times forever gone,
     Of the gray morning, and look vainly for
     Of the great names which in our faces stare,
       Of the high talents of this new Vauban:
       Of the Humane Society's beginning
     Of the immortal Peter's polish'd boors
     Of the imperial favourite's condition.
       Of their departure: such is modern fame:
     Of their designs, by saying they meant well;
     Of their exchanging glances of affection.
     Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,
       Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse
     Of the last foe is echoed by his own.
     Of the long caravan, which in the chill
       Of them his lips imperial ever spake!
       Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling
       Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,
       Of the official candidate. I 'll touch
       Of the pine forest, and the silent shore
     Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.
       Of the sad consequence of going astray,
     Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,
     Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.
     Of these few could say more than has been said;
       Of these is not exactly ascertain'd
       Of these things, or by ridicule benumb
     Of the 'Star Chamber' than of 'Habeas Corpus.'
     Of the strange thing some women set a value on,
       Of the third sex stept up, and peering over
           Of the three hundred grant but three,
       Of the troops were embark'd, the siege to raise,
     Of the true reason of his not being sad,
     Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!
       Of the two principles, but leaves behind
     Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand
     Of the world's stoics—men without a heart.'
     Of thine imaginary deathless tree,
       Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:
       Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;
       Of this enormous city's spreading span,
     Of this I 'm sure at least, there 's no servility
     Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp
       Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;
     Of this same mystic friar's curious doings,
       Of this their mutual feeling, she replied—
     Of this unsighing people of the woods.
     Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,
     Of those in office: all the world look'd kind
       Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound
     Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,
     Of those who cannot lay on a new tax.
     Of those who had most genius for this sort
       Of those who have not a license for the same;
       Of those who hold the kingdoms in control
       Of those who sail the seas, on the first day
       Of those with which his Haidee's bosom bounded?
       Of thought we could but snatch a certainty,
     Of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar
       Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,
       Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
       Of Titans, giants, fellows of about
       Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet
       Of travellers to mighty Babylon:
     Of truth;—such truths are treason; they betray
     Of truth than prose, unless to suit the mart
     Of tumbling first, and having in exchange
       Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)—
     Of twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge,—
           Of two such lessons, why forget
     Of two things—how (the question rather odd is)
     Of tyranny of all kinds, my concision
       Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:
       Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:
       Of various nations, and all volunteers;
       Of velvet panels, each of different hue,
     Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please
     Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,
     Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek
     Of war's most mortal engines, to their foes
       Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,
     (Of weariness or scorn), began to feel
       Of what befell our hero in the land,
     Of what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,
     Of what is call'd eternity, to stare,
     Of what is call'd the world, and the world's ways;
       Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's cal
     Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,
       Of what she had gone through with—since a bride.
     Of what she was, and is, if ye could call
     Of what should be monopoly—the heart.
       Of what they deem themselves most consequential,
       Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;
     Of which another's bosom is the zone.
       Of which he specified in this his pleading:
     Of which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,
       Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.
       (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),
     (Of which I might have a good deal to say,
     Of which most men partake, but no one sings.
     Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,
     Of which perhaps the latter is most true.
       Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,
     Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.
       Of which the latter merits every preference
     Of which the surest sign is in the end:
       Of which young passion cannot be bereft,
       Of which your lawful awful wedlock fount is,—
     Of white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings,
       Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,
     Of whom half my philosophy the progeny is.
       Of whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,
     Of whom we can insert but Rousamouski,
       Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray
       Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,
     Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish
     Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I

       Of yellow casimere we may presume,
       Of your own footsteps—voices from the urn
       Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,
     Of youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things
       Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing
     O, gentle ladies! should you seek to know
       O, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf
     O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,
     O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?
     O, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things—
     'Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?
     'Oh Jack! I 'm floor'd by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!'
     'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,
       'Oh!' saith the Psalmist, 'that I had a dove's
     'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'
     O job! you had two friends: one 's quite enough,
       O, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)—
       O, Julia! what is every other wo?
     O, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!
     Old enemies who have become new friends
     Olden she was—but had been very young;
       Old Erse or Irish, or it may be Punic
     Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes—
     Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,
     Old Lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,
     Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl—
     O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
     O, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,
     O Love! O Glory! what are ye who fly

     O Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why
     On Adeline while playing her grand role,
     On a fool's head—and there is London Town!
     On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow—
       On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;
     On board of one of these, and under hatches,
     Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
     Once, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd—the thing of air,
     On 'Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,
       On cities, as hath been the present case):
     On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;
       On crimson satin, border'd with pale blue;
       One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;
       On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,
     One bark blew up, a second near the works
       One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;
       One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;
     One difficulty still remain'd—his hair
     One gang of people instantly was put
       One glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!
       One half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,
     One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
     One large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,
     One makes new noses, one a guillotine,
       One man alone at first her heart can move;
       One monstrous diamond drew much observation,
     One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:'
     One of the two, according to your choice,
     One of the valorous 'Smiths' whom we shall miss
       (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)
     One of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt
     One of whom spoke their tongue—or well or ill,
     One on the arm, the other on the head.
     One on the other, throughout the whole hall,
     One or the other, but which of the two
     One or two stared the captives in the face,
     One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'
     One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'
     One's hip he slash'd, and split the other's shoulder,
       One should not rail without a decent cause:
     One 's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid,
     One system eats another up, and this
     One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,
     One with her flush'd cheek laid on her white arm,
       One wonder'd what to do with such a number
     On general topics: poems must confine
     On great occasions, such as an attack
     On her canals, where God takes sea and land,
     On her sire's arm, which until now scarce held
     On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view
       On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,
       On him the diamond pours its brilliant blaze,
       On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:—
       On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,—
       On life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,
     Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,
       Only the common run, who must pursue,
     Only the wall, instead of what he sought
     Only to draw them 'twixt two bastion corners,
     Only to keep its corn at the old price.
       On many a token without knowing what;
       On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;
       On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:
     On one another, and each lovely lisper
       On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill
     On our fresh feelings, but—as being participated
     On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,
     On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.
     On purpose to believe so much the more.
     On ready money, or 'a draft on Ransom.'
       On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.
     On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;
       On so uncontrovertible a level,
       On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,
     On such a subject; then suppose the face
       On such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,
       On such occasions: not a single head
             On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,
     On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,
       On that beloved daughter; she had been
       On that sweet ore which every body nurses;—
     On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.
       On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?
     On them and bread 't was oft my luck to dine,
       On the most favour'd; and amidst the blaze
     'On the rough deep. But this last blow-' and here
     On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,
     On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak
       On through a farther range of goodly rooms,
       On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;
       On to the house, but by a private way,
       On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?
       On what I 've seen or ponder'd, sad or cheery;
     On what may suit or may not suit my story,
     On which, at the third asking of the bans,
     On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.
       On which I have not time just now to lecture.
       On which it hinges in a higher station;
     On which Jack and his train set off at speed,
     On which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,
     On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers
       On which the Muse has always sought to enter.
       On which the passion's self seems to depend:
     On which the rest, without more intermission,
     On which they might repose, or even commence
     On which three single hours of moonshine smile—
     On whom her reveries celestial ran.
     On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!
     O! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,
     O, pardon my digression—or at least

     Or as the stirring of a deep dear stream

     Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.
       Particularly with a tiresome friend:
       Partly perhaps because a fresh sensation,
     Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,
       Pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell
       Pass'd without words—in fact she could not speak;
       Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,
       Passive obedience,—now raised up the head,
     Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,
     Past, present, and to come;—but all may yield
      Patient, but not enamoured of endurance;
     Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus—
       'Paulo Majora.' Juan, undecided
     Paused for a moment, from the fight, and cast
     Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower—
       Peace, war, the taxes, and what 's call'd the 'Nation'?
     'Pedlars,' and 'Boats,' and 'Waggons!' Oh! ye shades

     People are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,
       People should hold their tongues in any case;
     People some ten times less in fact to mind it,

       Perceiving fie was in a handsome way
       Perceiving in his absence such expenses,
     Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,
     Perceiving then no more the commandant
     Perchance the death of one she loved too well:
     Perfect she was, but as perfection is
       Perforce, since whatsoever met her view
       Perhaps a little later, her great lord,
       Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,
     Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.
     Perhaps as wretched if a peasant's quean.
       Perhaps because 't was fallen: her sires were proud
       Perhaps be weigh'd hereafter, if not now;
     Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks
     Perhaps—but, sans perhaps, we need not seek
     Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,
     Perhaps even more attention than is due
       Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;
     Perhaps from Horace: his 'Nil admirari'
     Perhaps he fain would liberate mankind
     Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,
     Perhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes
     Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,
     Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull
     Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.
     Perhaps I have a third, too, in a nook,
       'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,
     Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.
     Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.
       Perhaps it may set out on its return,—
       Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.
     Perhaps mankind might find the path they miss—
     Perhaps may find it better than a new one)—
     Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw
     Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for
       Perhaps no better than they have treated me

     Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,
     Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
     Perhaps she did not like the quiet way
       Perhaps she had nothing to confess:—no matter,
     Perhaps she merely had the simple project
     Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,
     Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,
     Perhaps she wish'd an aspirant profounder;
       Perhaps some virtuous blushes; let them go.
       Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;
       Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age—
     Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:—
     Perhaps there may be something in 'the grove,'
     Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.
     Perhaps there 's nothing—I 'll not say appals,
       Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:
       Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station
       Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void
     Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.
     Perhaps this is as it should be;—it is
     Perhaps this new position—but I 'm right;
     'Perhaps,' thought he, 'it is the country's wont
     'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
       Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
     Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
     Perhaps 't was hardly quite assured enough,
     Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
     Perhaps we have borrow'd this from the Chinese—

     She had no prudence, but he had; and this
     She had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;
     She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,
     She had resolved that he should travel through
     She had some other motive much more near
     She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.
     She had so much, or little, of the child.
       She hardly knew, to such perfection brings
     She has served me also much the same as you,
     She held their old faith and old feelings fast.
       She hoped he would improve—perhaps believed:
     She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.
       She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.
     She keeps it for you like a true ally.
     She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
     She kept her counsel in so close a way.
     She knew not her own heart; then how should I?
     She knew that the best feelings must have victual,
     She knew the Latin—that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'
       She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
     She liked quick answers in all conversations;
     She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,
     She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,
     She look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale
       She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,
     She look'd as if she sat by Eden's door.
     She look'd on many a face with vacant eye,
     She look'd (this simile 's quite new) just cut
     She loved, and was beloved—she adored,
     She loved her lord, or thought so; but that love
     She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
     She made the earth below seem holy ground.
     She married (I forget the pedigree)
     She marvell'd 'what he saw in such a baby
     She merely felt a common sympathy
       She merely was deem'd amiable and witty,
       She must not own, but cherish'd more the while
     She never thought about herself at all.
       She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
       She next decided he was only bad;
       She now conceived all difficulties past,
     She now determined that a virtuous woman
     She now kept house upon her own account.
     She order'd him directly to be bought,
       Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,
     She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,
     She promised never more to have a dream,
     She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
       She put all coronets into commotion:
     She read some French romances here and there,
     She recognized no being, and no spot,
     She rings the world's 'Te Deum,' and her brow
     She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw
     She sate, but not alone; I know not well
     She saw he did not understand Romaic.
     She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
     She saw them watch her without asking why,
       She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
       She seem'd by the distraction of her air.
       She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon
     She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.
     She seriously advised him to get married.
       She show'd a great dislike to holy water:
       She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem
     She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,
     She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,
       She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw
     She snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,
     She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.
     She spake some words to her attendants, who
     She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.
     She stood a moment as a Pythones
     She stood as one who champion'd human fears—
     She stopp'd, and raised her head to speak—but paused,
     She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,
     She then prefers him in the plural number,
     She then resolved to send him on a mission,
     She thought hers gave a double 'right divine;'
     She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
     She thought of killing Juan—but, poor lad!
       She thought that her lord's heart (even could she claim it)
     She thought to stab herself, but then she had
     She thought upon the subject twice or thrice,
       She thought with some simplicity indeed;
     She to dismiss her guards and he his haram,
     She took his lady also in affection,
     She took Juanna by the hand to show
     She took up with some foreign younger brother,
       She, too, was fortunate last carnival,
     She turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort
     She vow'd she never would see Juan more,
     She waited on her lady with the sun,
     She waited until justice could recall
     She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,
     She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,
     She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,
     She was all which pure ignorance allows,
       She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.
     She was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.
     She was as capable as woman can be.
     She was a sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).
     She was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,
     She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,
     She was not violently lively, but
     She was of course the favorite of the four.
     She was, or thought she was, his friend—and this
       She was so like a vision; I might err,
       She was the mild reprover of the young,
     She whisper'd, in great wrath—'I must deposit
     She who for many years had watch'd her son so—
     She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,
     She wonder'd at herself how she could scream—
       She wore two jelicks—one was of pale yellow;
       She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
     She would revoke the order he had heard.
     Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.
       Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;
       Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;
       Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,
       Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly
     Short solace, vain relief!—thought came too quick,
     Short speeches pass between two men who speak
     Short upper lip—sweet lips! that make us sigh
     Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;
     Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
     Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity.
       Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild
       Should ever give her heart the least sensation;
     Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.
     Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.
     Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.
     Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize
     Should now be butcher'd in a civic alley.
       Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)
       Should rather face and overcome temptation,
     Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as death
       Should so continue—'t is a point of honour;
       Should still be singed, but slightly let me state)
       Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
     Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,
       Show'd Juan, or Juanna, through and through
       Show'd that somewhere, somehow, there was a fault,
     Show'd what things were before the world was free!
     Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss
     Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,
     Shown in the following copy of her Letter:—
       Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;
     Show off—to please their company or mother.
     Shows stars and women in a better light.
       Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;
     Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.
     Show what the passions are in their full growth.

     Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at

     Shut up—no, not the King, but the Pavilion,
     Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!
     Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;
     Sigh—as the postboys fasten on the traces.
     Sigh'd for their sakes—that they should e'er grow older.
     Sigh'd Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,
     Sigh'd to behold them of their hours bereft,
     Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?
       Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander
       (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)
       Silence is best, besides there is a tact
     Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
     Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;
     Simple, serene, the antipodes of shame,
     Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,
     Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.
       Since Adeline was liberal by nature;
       Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair
     Since burning aged women (save a few,
     Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.
       Since first her majesty was singly crown'd:
       Since gold alone should not have been its price.

     Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,

     Since I 've grown moral, still I must accuse you all
       Since John has lately lost the use of both.
       Since lately there have been no rents at all,
       Since laughter now-a-days is deem'd too serious.
       Since 'Mene, Mene, Tekel,' and 'Upharsin,'
       Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;

       Sleeping, most probably,—when at her door
       Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;
     Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,
       Slight but select, and just enough to express,
     Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;
       Slowly along the room, but silent still,
     Slowly distill'd into the glimmering glass
     Small is the rest of those who would be smart,
       Small pity had he for the young and fair,
       Small social parties just begun to dine;
     Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets

       Smiled scornfully, and said, 'Within my call,

     So agitated was she with her error,
     So animated that it might allure
       So Arab deserts drink in summer's rain:
     So as I gazed on him, I thought or said—
     So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.
       So as to make them feel he knew his station
     So beautiful—its very shape would charm;
     So beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.
     So beautiful that art could little mend her,
     So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,
     So brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is,—
       So by the poesy of his own mind
       So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,
       So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,
     So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:
     So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own
     So Catherine, who had a handsome way
       So celebrated for his morals, when
       So changeable had been the winds that blew;
       (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
     Society is now one polish'd horde,
     Society is smooth'd to that excess,
     Society itself, which should create
     Society, that china without flaw
       So costly were they; carpets every stitch
     So Cowper says—and I begin to be
     Socrates said, our only knowledge was
     So Cuvier says;—and then shall come again
       'Sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.
       So dear is still the memory of that dream;
       So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:
       So every one may dress it to his wish,
     So far above the cunning powers of hell,
     So far relax'd her thoughts from their sweet prison,
     Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,
     So first there was a generous emulation,
     So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
       Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;
       Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried
       Softest of melodies; and could be sad
     Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart
     Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,
     Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration
     So fully flash'd the phantom on his eyes,
     So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste—
     So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,
       So good an opportunity, no doubt:—
     So good—I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.
     So he began to stammer some excuses;
     So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,
     So Juan, following honour and his nose,
     So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,
     So Juan stood, bewilder'd on the deck:
       So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how;
     So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews

       So little they expected him that day;
     So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,
       So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour
     So long I 've battled either more or less,
       So loving and so lovely—till then never,
     So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.
     So many false long tresses all to spare,
     So many troubles from her birth beset her,
       Some acids with the sweets—for she was heady;
     Some are soon bagg'd, and some reject three dozen.
       Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
       Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.
       Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch
       Some by a place—as tend their years or natures;
     Some by experience, others by tradition.
     Some call thee 'the worst cause of war,' but I
       Some chaste liaison of the kind—I mean
     Some Christians have a comfortable creed.
     Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,
     Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,
       Some days and nights elapsed before that he
     Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen
       Some deem it but the distant echo given
       Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows
     Some die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,
     Some difficulties, as in his own preference,
       Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:
     Some doubt how much of Adeline was real;
       Some down, and weighing others in their hand,
     Some drama of the marriage unities,
     Some dull MS. oblivion long has sank,
       Some exiles from the town, who had been driven
     Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls
     Some fancied they saw land, and some said 'No!'
     Some favour'd object; and as in the niche
     Some feelings, universal as the sun,
       Some female head most curiously presumes
     Some fine examples of the epopee,
     Some for amusement, others for old grudges.
       Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,
     Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,
     Some hands unseen strew'd flowers upon his tomb:
     Some have accused me of a strange design
       Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not—
     Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,
     Some heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks:
       Some heir to a large property, some friend
       Some hock and soda-water, then you 'll know
       Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
     Some hoped things might not turn out as they fear'd;
     Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.
     Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,
     Some hundreds breathed—the rest were silent all!
       Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:—
     Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,
     Some laid aside like an old Opera hat,
       Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,
     Some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on
       Some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;
       Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,
     Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
       Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;
       Some look'd perplex'd, and others look'd profound;
       Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers;
     Some millions must be wrong, that 's pretty dear;
       Some mind their household, others dissipation,
     Some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;
       Some new experiment to show his parts;
     Some nodded to the negro from their station,
     Some odd mistakes, too, happen'd in the dark,
     Some parts of Juan's history, which Rumour,
       Some people have accused me of misanthropy;
       Some people prefer wine—'t is not amiss;
     Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,
     Some people would impose now with authority,
     Some persons say that Dante meant theology
     Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;
     Some play the devil, and then write a novel.
       Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:
     Some plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,
       Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;
     Some praised her beauty; others her great grace;
     Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.
     Some reckon women by their suns or years,
     Some rumour also of some strange adventures
     Some run away, and but exchange their cares,
       Some said he had been poison'd by Potemkin;
     Some said her years were getting nigh their summer,
     Some said 't was a concoction of the humours,
       Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing
     Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare
     Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,
       Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:
       Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
     Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,
       Some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,
     Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,
     Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,
     Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,
       Something about the Baltic's navigation,
     Something, but what 's not stated in my tale.
     Something imperial, or imperious, threw
       Something like illness of a sudden growth
     Something of which its masters are afraid,
     Some thought her dress did not so much become her,
     Some thought her rather masculine in height,
     Some thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,
     Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,
     Sometimes a little heavy on the backs
       Sometimes a little later. I don't err
       Sometimes at six years old—though it seems odd,
     Sometimes calls 'murder,' and at others 'glory.'
     Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,
     Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,
     Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);
       Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion
       Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;
     Some to their several pastimes, or to none,
     Some trial had been making at a raft,
       Some truths are better kept behind a screen,
     Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;
     Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,
     Some voices of the buxom middle-aged
     Some waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss
     Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
     Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,
     Some went to prayers again, and made a vow
     Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,
     Some women use their tongues—she look'd a lecture,
       Some wondering 't was so early, some so late.
       Some would not deem such women could be found;
     Some years before the incidents related.
     So much as I do any kind of wrangle;
     So much as to propose to take a walk,—
       So much as under a triumphal arch,
       So much as when we call our old debts in
     So much did Juan's setting off distress her,
       So much distrait he was, that all could see
     So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.
     So much for Nature:—by way of variety,
     So much, he always doubted I was married—
       So much he deem'd his patronage an honour,
       So much indeed as to be downright rude;
       So much into the raw as quite to wrong her
       So much less fight as might form an apology
     So much, the bard had really been prophetic
     So much the better!—I may stand alone,
       'So much the better,' Juan said, 'for them;
       So much the present dye, she was remote;
     So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,
     Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,
       Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;
     So nobody arrived on shore but him.
     'So now, my lads, for glory!'—Here he turn'd
       So often urged, so loudly and so long:
     Sooner 'come lace into the civil list
       Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,
     'Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),
     Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,
     So on I ramble, now and then narrating,
       So order'd it, amidst these sulphury revels,
     So perish every tyrant's robe piece-meal!
       Sophia's cupola with golden gleam;
     So pick and choose—perhaps you 'll be content
     So placed as to impede the fire of those
     So precious that it was not to be bought,
     So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?
       So recollect that the extremest grace
     So said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken
     So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.
       So says the proverb—and I quite agree;
     So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
       So silly as to buy slaves who might share
       So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving
       So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,
       So styled according to the usual forms
     So supernatural was her passion's rise;
     So take him up; I 'll help you with the load.'
       (So take it in the very words of Creech)—
     So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
     So that all hands were busy beyond measure,
     So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,
       So that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard:
     So that a suit or action were made good,
       So that civilisation they may learn;
     So that even those whose faith is the most great
     So that few members kept the house up later.
     So that he had much better cause to grieve
       So that, her father being at sea, she was
     So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.
       So that he would have been the very donor,
     So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,
     So that I almost think that the same skin
     So that I do not grossly err in facts,
     So that if any actor miss'd his part
     So that I trust for everybody's sake,
       So that I verily believe if they
     So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.
     So that on either side some nine or ten
       So that some disappointment there ensued
     So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,
     So that the few who met him hardly heeded,
     So that the heir apparent still was found
     So that their bargain sounded like a battle
       (So that their efforts should at length prevail)
     So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
     So that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,
       So that the outline 's tolerably fair,
     So that the philosophical beholder
     So that there was no reason for their loves
     So that the streets of colour'd lamps are full,
     So that we can our native sun assuage
     So that you have not been nor will be lovers.
     So that you scarce could say who best had chosen,
     So the end 's gain'd, what signifies the route?
     So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
     Souls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches
     Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,
     Sound, and then by a cry, 'The Sultan 's coming!'
       Sounding like very supernatural water,
           Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
     Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.
     Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon
       Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;
     'Soupe a la Beauveau,' whose relief was dory,
     Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,
     So very difficult, they say, it is
     So vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;
     So was her creed in her own innocence.
     So was his blood stirr'd while he found resistance,
       So well not one of the aforesaid paints
     So well she acted all and every part
     So well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.
     So were the Cretans—from which I infer
     So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor
       So you may take your choice of this or that)—
       Space to dispute what no one ever could
     Spain may prove an exception to the rule,
     Spangled with gems—the monk made his blood curdle.
       Spared by some chance when all beside was spoil'd;
       Spared neither sex nor age in their career
     Spare, or smite rarely—man's make millions ashes!
       Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase
     Sparkled with her successful prophecies,
       Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,
       Speak!' but he spoke not: 'Wake!' but still he slept:—
       Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent
     Splendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping,
     Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:
       Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;
       Sprinkled with palaces; the ocean stream
       Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;
     Spurr'd her to teach another generation.
     Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.
     Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,
       Stands on her tripod, agonised, and full
       Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,
       Started the stern-post, also shatter'd the
       Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,
       (Start not, kind reader; since great Homer thought
       Start not! still chaster reader—she 'll be nice hence—
     Stated) his mouth. What open'd next?—the door.
     Statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings,
       State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,
       States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,
       Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)—
     Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.
     Steel barons, molten the next generation
       Stern as her sire: 'On me,' she cried, 'let death
       Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,
       Still breaking, but with stamina so steady
       Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother
       Still gentler purchaser! the bard—that 's I—
     Still he forgot not his disguise:—along
     Still I have no dislike to learned natures,
     Still I 'll record a few, if but to increase
     Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree
       Still kept his spirits up—at least his face;
     Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime
     Still older mansion; of a rich and rare
       Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,
     Still swam—though not exactly like a duck.
       Still their salvation was an even bet:
     Still there was something wanting, as I 've said—
       Still unimpair'd, to decorate the scene;
     Still we respect thee, 'Alma Venus Genetrix!'
       Stirr'd up and down her bosom like a billow,
     Stirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.
     Stitch'd up in sacks—a mode of navigation
     St. James's Palace and St. James's 'Hells.'
       Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;
       Stone-Henge is not—but what the devil is it?-
     Stones and whatever she could pick up, to
     Stood calling out for bandages and lint,
     Stood like Caractacus in act to rally
     'Stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian
       Stopp'd as if once more willing to concede
       Stopp'd for a minute, as perhaps he ought
     'Stop!' so I stopp'd.—But to return: that which
     (St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).
     Strain'd on the spot where first the figure gleam'd;
     Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,
     Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,
       Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,
     Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,
     Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)
     Strange too in my 'buon camerado' Scott,
       Streaming from off the sun like seraph's wings,
       Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,
     Stretch'd in the street, and able scarce to pant.
       Strict, and his mind assumed a manlier vigour;
     Stript to his shirt, was come to lead the van.
     Stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,
       Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,
     Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;
       Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,
     Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.
     Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,
     Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache
     Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.
       Such aberrations than we men of rigour:
       Such appetite in one she had deem'd dead;
       Such are—but I have lost the London Chart.
     Such as are coin'd in conversation's mint,
     Such as enables man to show his strength
       Such as he thought the least given up to prey;
       Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:
     Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece
       Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:
     Such as the angels think so very fine,
       Such as the conqueror William did repay
             Such as the Doric mothers bore;
       Such as the times may furnish. 'T is a flight
     Such as—'Unless Miss (Blank) meant to have chosen
     Such as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true—tears
     Such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies.
           Such chains as his were sure to bind.
     Such classic pas—sans flaws—set off our hero,
     Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better
     Such difference doth a few months make. You 'd think
       Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.
       (Such, early traveller! is the truth thou learnest)—
     Such I might stumble over unawares,
       Such is the shortest way to general curses.
     Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.
     Such is your cold coquette, who can't say 'No,'
       Such kisses as belong to early days,
     Such love is innocent, and may exist
       Such measures as she thought might best impede
     Such names at present cut a convict figure,
     Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one
     Such plentiful precautions, that still he
     Such pure disinterestedness of passion,
       Such small distinction between friends and foes,
       Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;
     Such things a mother had not known her son
       (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar):
       Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;
     Such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;
     Such was her coldness or her self-possession.
     Such was his sovereign's pleasure (though unfit,
     Such was his tact, he could alike delight
     Such were his trophies—not of spear and shield,
       Such worthies Time will never see again;
       Suck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;
     Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
     'Sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation
     Suggested some slight comfort in his way:
       Sultana, think upon the consequence:
     Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,
       Summers could renovate, though they should be
       Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
       Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;
     Sunk, and the crimson cross glared o'er the field,
     Suns as rays—worlds like atoms—years like hours?
       Sunset the time, the place the same declivity
     Superbly, and contain'd a world of zest.
     Suppose,—but you already have supposed,

     Suppress, then, some slight feminine diseases,
     Surely the window 's not so very high!'
       Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see
     Sure my invention must be down at zero,
     'Surgit amari aliquid'—the toll
     Surmounted as its clasp—a glowing crescent,
       Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,
       Surprise has this effect—to make one dumb,
     Survey'd him with a kind of calm surprise.
       Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;
     Survives himself, his tomb, and all that 's his.
       Survive through very desperate conditions,
     Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.
       Suspended may illuminate mankind,
       Suspicion: though not timid, his regard
     Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,
       Sustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;
     Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,
     Suwarrow now was conqueror—a match
     Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high
     Suwarrow, when he saw this company
     Suwarrow,—who but saw things in the gross,
     Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,
     Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt
     Swam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:
     Swear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime
     Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,
       Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay world's hum,
     Sweet hour of twilight!—in the solitude
     Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
     Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;
     Sweet is revenge—especially to women,
     Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
       Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!
     Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd
     Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;
     'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;
       Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,
     Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
       Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange
     Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
       Swore praises, and recall'd their former fires;
     Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,
       Symmetrical, but deck'd with carvings quaint—
     Take care what you reply to such a letter.
     (Take her at thirty, that is) to have been
       Take lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:
     Takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,

     Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,
     Taking her for a sister; just the same

       'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'
     Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven
     Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.
       Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd
     Tall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van
     'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,
       Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,
     Taste or the gout,—pronounce it as inclines
     Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).
     Tastes, we are going to try the supernatural.
       Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond
     Teach them that 'sauce for goose is sauce for gander,'
     Teach them the decencies of good threescore;
     Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,
     Tears shed into the grave of the connection
       Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,
     Tell me—and be assured, that since you stain

     Tell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,
     Tell them that youth once gone returns no more,
     Tell them, though it may be perhaps too late,
     Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.
     Temperate I am, yet never had a temper;
       Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,
       Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;
     Than admiration due where nature's rich
     Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).
       Than an advertisement, or much the same;
     Than an enormous room without a soul
     Than any other scrape, a thing of course.
       Than any since the birthday of typography;
     Than are your mighty passions and so forth,
       Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on
       Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he
       Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:
     Than did the prima donna and the tenor.
     Than dying tapers—and the peeping moon.
     Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,
       Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,
     Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.
       Than he, in these sad highways left at large
     Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.
     Than human insects, catering for spiders.
       Than if I sought to sail before the wind.
     Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.
       Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.
       Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;
     Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!
       Than is the custom of the gentle sex,
     Than Jose, who begot our hero, who
     Thank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready
     Than lessen it by what I could relate
       Than many persons more advanced in life;
       Than match-making in general: 't is no sin
       Than might suffice a moderate century through.
     Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,
       Than on the name a person leaves behind:
       Than other articles of female dress.
        Than others crowded in the forest's maze);
       Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;
       Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,
     Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),
       Than storms it as a foe would take a city;
     Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,
     Than the eternal deluge, which devours
       Than their he relatives), like flies o'er candy
       Than the mere plodding through each 'vulgar fraction'?
     Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast
     Than these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope—
     Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,
     Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire
     Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.
       Than those who were not paid for independence,

     Than you would make the half of;—don't say no;
     That Adam, call'd 'The happiest of men.'

     That all is dubious which man may attain,
       That all is settled:—there was little din,
     That all 's ideal—all ourselves: I 'll stake the
     That all the Apostles would have done as they did.
     That all their glory, as a composition,
     That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
       That all the rest creep in and form a junction,
     That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'
     That all within was not so very well,
     That a mere Christian should be half so pretty.'
          That ancient line, in the "we moonshine
     That anybody should disturb you so;
     That any thing he views can greatly please.
       That a report (especially the Greeks)
     That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,
     That at this moment Juan knew it not.
       That awful pause, dividing life from death,
     That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.
       That bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd
     That beef and battles both were owing to her.
     That begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,
       That being about their average numeral;
       That being about the number I 'll allow
       That being the last thing a proud woman tries;
       That both are tied till one shall have expired.
     That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,
     That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam
       That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.
       That—but ask any woman if she'd choose
       That—but my chaster ear will not receive
       That calm patrician polish in the address,
       That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;
     That casque, which never stoop'd except to Time.
       That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed;
       That cocking of a pistol, when you know
       That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,
       That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)—
       That daughters of such mothers as may know
       That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
     That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?
     That drinks and still is dry. At last they perish'd—
     That each pull'd different ways with many an oath,
     That e'er by precious metal was held in.
       That e'er were brew'd from elements or gore,
     That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,
     That even the able seaman, deeming his
     That even the purest people may mistake
     That ever made a youthful heart less steady,
     That ever peopled hell with heroes slain,
       That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:
     That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,
     That famish'd people must be slowly nurst,
       That fever which precedes the languid rout
     That few or none more than himself had caught
     That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;
     That flash'd and after darken'd in the shade.
     That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
       That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy
     That from the first of Cantos up to this
     That future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.
       That gentleman of lords and gentlemen;
     'That good but rarely came from good advice.'
       That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving
     That great enchanter, at whose rod's command
     That had for centuries been known in Spain,
       That half its produce tends to emigration,
     That happiness for man—the hungry sinner!-
     That hater of mankind, would be a shame,
       That hath a memory, or that had a heart?
     That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!
     That he exactly the just medium hit
       That he had made at first a silly blunder
     That he himself felt only 'like a youth
       That he the night before had seen a ghost,
     That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.
       That he was not an ancient debauchee
     That he was not in heart so very weak;—I meant
       That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:
       That he would rather make them more than less.
     That hides the past world, like to a set sun
       That hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;
       That honey of your fashionable bees—
       That horrid equinox, that hateful section
     That hour is not for us, but 't is for you:
     That howsoever people fast and pray,
     That I devoutly wish'd the three were four,
     That I dissert, like grace before a feast:
     That if I had an only son to put
     That I have chosen a confessor so old
       That I must have recourse to black Bohea:
       That I must say who knew him very well;
     That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
     That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse
     That innovation's spirit now-a-days
       That in our youth, as dangerous a passion
       That in the course of some six thousand years,
       That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,
       That is, ere midnight—which is London's noon:
     That I should fall into a monster's power.
     That isle is now all desolate and bare,
     That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.
     That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,
     That is—the Lady:' clapping his hands twice,
     That is the usual method, but not mine—
     That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.
     That is to say, a thought beyond the common
     That is to say in a meridian clime—
     That is, up to a certain point; which point
     That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,
       That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed
     That is, with men: with women he was what
       That is, with thirty servants for parade,
     That is your present theme for popularity:
       That I unsex'd my dress?' But Baba, stroking
     That Johnson and some few who had not scamper'd,
       That Juan had enough of maintenance,
     That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum
       That Juan was unlikely to resist
     That just as her young lip began to ope
     That killing him is not the way to cure you.'
       That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same
       That ladies in their youth a little gay,
     That lady, who should be at home to all.
     That large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate
     That leads to lassitude, the most infected
     That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;
     That like to make a quarrel, when they can't
       That live gazette, had scatter'd to disfigure,
     That love and marriage rarely can combine,
       That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;
       That made his eyelids as a woman's be,
       That madmen may not bite you on a visit;
       (That make old Europe's journals squeak and gibber all.)
     That manners hardly differ more than dress.
       That many of the ills o'er which man grieves,
     (That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,
     That monstrous hieroglyphic—that long spout
     That most unliquidating liquid, leaves
       That neither of their intellects are vast:
     That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.
       That noble sight, when really free the nation,
     That nobody can ever take amiss,
       That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.
       That no one has succeeded in describing
     That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals
     That novelties please less than they impress.
       That of despising those we combat with,
     That on a sudden, when she least had hope,
       That one life saved, especially if young
       That one scarce knew at what to marvel most
     That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)—
     That one would think the first who bore it 'Adam.'
     That opposition only more attaches—
       That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,
     That painting is no idol,—'t is too like.
     That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,
     That passengers would find it much amiss
     That pleasant capital of painted snows;
       That poesy has wreaths for you alone.
     That poets were so from their earliest date,
     That prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith
       (That royal bird, whose tail 's a diadem),
       That sad inexplicable beast of prey—
     That sad result of passions and potatoes—
       That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion
     That 's an appropriate simile, that jackal;—
     That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,
     'That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies.'
     That she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,
     That she must often navigate o'er fiction.
       That she spawns warriors by the score, where none
     That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;
     That she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,
     That sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.
     That 's noble! That 's romantic! For my part,
       That some, I really think, do never die;
     That something was the matter—Adeline
       That somewhat manly majesty of stride,
     That sons should not be educated so.
       That soon his head was most completely crown'd,
     That source of the sublime and the mysterious:—
       That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair—
     That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,
       That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!
     That 's rather fine. The gentle sound of Thamis—
     That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,
     That still he 'd wed with such or such a lady,
     That stranger to most councils, here prevail'd,
     That stretches to the stony belt, which girds
       That such existed? (and they may live now
     That suit in Chancery,—which some persons plead
     That 's your affair, not mine: a real spirit
     That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,
     That the fatigue was greater than the profit.
     That the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,
       That the old fable of the Minotaur—
     That there are months which nature grows more merry in,—
     That therefore do I previously declare,
       That there had been a lady in the case;
     That there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.
       That the sail was becalm'd between the seas,
       That these were merely masquerading Tartars,
     That they as easily might do the youngster,
       That they bred in and in, as might be shown,
       That they have nothing better near, or newer.
     That they must instantly be well array'd,
     That the young lady made a monstrous choice.
       That the young stranger should not lie alone,
       That they should all be shot on the next day;
       That they were going to a marriage feast
     That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,
     That this disguise may lead to no mistake.'
       That this is not a moral tale, though gay;
     That though he look'd one of the seraphim,
       That till we see what 's what in fact, we 're far
     That time has left our fathers of their hall.
     That time would temper Juan's faults of youth;
     That trash of such sort not alone evades
     That turns and turns to give the world a notion
           That tyrant was Miltiades!
       That undefinable 'Je ne scais quoi,'
       That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,
       That usual paragon, an only daughter,
     That violent things more quickly find a term
       That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,
     That watery outline of eternity,
       That waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,
       That went before; in these I shall enrich
       That we ourselves—'t was in the honey-moon—
     That when a culprit came far condemnation,
       That when the very lance was in his heart,
     That where their education, harsh or mild,
     That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.
       That which a portal to their eyes did seem,—
       That which humanity may bear, or bear not:
     That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;
       (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit
       That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob
     That, without any danger of a riot, he
     That without notice few full moons shall pass it;
     That with the addition of a slight pelisse,
     That womankind had but one rosy mouth,
     That word is idle now—but let it go.
       That worse than worst of foes, the once adored
       That ye are dogs—your betters far—ye may
     That you and I will win St. George's collar.
     That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'
       That young men rarely made monastic vows;
       The absence of that more sublime construction,
     The accused to think their lordships would determine
       The admirations and the speculations;

       The age discovers he is not the true one;
       The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,
     The air of ''T was a Friar of Orders Gray.'
       The airy child of vapour and the sun,
       The allegory) a mere type, no more,
     The animals aforesaid occupied
       The annals of full many a line undone,—
     The answer eloquent, where soul shines
       The antechamber—search them under, over;

     The antique Persians taught three useful things,

     The approach of home to husbands and to sires,
     The Arab lore and poet's song were done,
     The armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.
     The army, like a lion from his den,
     The art of living in all climes with ease.
     The arts, at least all such as could be said
       The arts of which these lands were once the font:
     The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,
     The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.
       The attorney last, who linger'd near the door
     The awkward squad, and could afford to squander

     The basquina and the mantilla, they

     The blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow
     The blood of all his line 's Castilian lords
     The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,
       The bloom, too, had return'd to Haidee's cheeks,
     The blows upon his cutlass, and then put
       The blue sea's border; and I Don Juan felt—
     The Blues, that tender tribe who sigh o'er sonnets,
     The boat made way; yet now they were so low,
     The boats, as stated, had got off before,
       The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;

       The boors cried 'Dang it? who 'd have thought it?'—Sires,

     The captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age,
     The cargoes he confiscated, and gain
       The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;
     The cause, but Juan said, 'He was quite well.'
     The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such
       The cause of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith;
     The cause of this effect, or this defect,—
     The cause of this odd travesty?'—'Forbear,'
       The cells, too, and refectory, I ween:
     The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
       The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,
       The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
       The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,
       The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.
     The chaste description even of a 'becasse;'
     The chief dame of the Oda, upon whom
       The chieftain's trophy, and the poet's volume,
       The child 's a pretty child—a very pretty—
       The chimney—which would really hold a lover.

     The circumstances seem the sport of men.'
       The city's shape suggested this, 't is true;
     The city 's taken, but not render'd!—No!
     The city 's taken—only part by part—
       The city, without being farther hamper'd;

       The coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;
       The colour of a budding rose's crest.
     The column order'd on the assault scarce pass'd
     The columns were in movement one and all,
       The common privileges of my sex?
       The company prepared to separate;
       The company, whose birth, wealth, worth have cost
     The conference or congress (for it ended
     The conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders
     The consequence is, being of no party,
       The consequence was awful in the extreme;
     The consequence was easily foreseen—
     The constable, beneath a warrant's banner,
       The contrary; but then 't is in the head;
       The conversazione; the duet,
       The copious use of claret is forbid too,
     The corn is cut, the manor full of game;
     The cost would be a trifle—an 'old song,'
     The coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,
       The country would have far more cause to weep it:
       The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
     The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;
     The courtiers stared, the ladies whisper'd, and
     The court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,
     The cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell down
     The creature was his father's dog that died,
     The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,
       The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low
     The cubless tigress in her jungle raging
     The cutting off his head was not the art
     The cypress groves; Olympus high and hoar;
       The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;
     The dame replied, 'Between your dreams and you,
     The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,
     The dangerous life in which he had grown old,
       The dappled foresters—as day awoke,
     The darkness of her Oriental eye
     The dashing and proud air of Adeline
     The day before, fast sleeping on the water,
     The day before the assault, while upon drill—
     The days of Comedy are gone, alas!
     The death-cry drowning in the battle's roar.
     The death-disgorging rampart once again;
     The death of friends, and that which slays even more—
       The death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,
     The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.
     The Dee, the Don, Balgounie's brig's black wall,

     The devil may decompose, but never settle:
       The devil may take that stealthy pace of his!
       The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they
       The devil 's in the urchin, and no good—
       The devil 's so very sly—she should discover
     The devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?
     The dice seem'd charm'd, too, with his repartees.
     The difference is, that in the days of old
     The difficultly lies in colouring
       The diners of celebrity dined well;
     The dinner and the soiree too were done,
     The dinner made about a hundred dishes;
       The discipline of the whole haram bore,
       The distant dog-bark; and perceived between
     The door flew wide,—not swiftly, but, as fly
       The door is open—you may yet slip through
     The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist
     The door was fasten'd in his legal face.
     The drainer of oblivion, even the sot,
     The dream changed:—in a cave she stood, its walls
       The dreary 'Fuimus' of all things human,
       The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill
     The Druids' groves are gone—so much the better:
     The drying up a single tear has more

     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'
       The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?
       The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show
       The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;
     The dying embers dwindle in the grate—
       The dying man cried, 'Hold! I 've got my gruel!
     The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow
     The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.
     The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes
     The earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,
     The earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad
       The earth has nothing like a she epistle,
       The earth, which he became like a fell'd tree,
     The effect on Juan was of course sublime:
       The effeminate garb?'—thus, after a short pause,
     The elder ladies' wrinkles curl'd much crisper
     The elderly walk'd through the library,
     The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,
       The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown'd—
       The empress was alarm'd, and her physician

     The eye might doubt if it were well awake,
     The fact, excepting some experienced few;
     The fact for words, and let the French translate
     The fact:—I 've heard it—once perhaps too much.
     The fact 's about the same, I am secure;
     The faculty—who said that he must travel.
       The fair czarina's autocratic crest,
       The fair Fitz-Fulke seem'd very much at ease;
     The fair most fatal Juan ever met,
     The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,

     The favour of the empress was agreeable;
     The fellow to lie groaning on the road:
       The female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd
     The females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,
     The festal midnight, and the levee morn.

       The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,
     The first attack at once proved the Divinity
     The first—but what she could not well divine.
     The first is rather more than mortal can do;
       The first the emblem (rarely though) of what
     The first thing boys like after play and fruit;
       The first time thought quite terrible enough
     The first was to bombard it, and knock down
     The first with sighs, the second with an oath,
     The first yet frown'd superbly o'er the soil,
     The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,
       The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
     The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;
     The fool will call such mania a disease:—
     The foremost in the charge or in the sally,
     The former in a palace, where like nuns
     The former know what 's what; while new-fledged chicks

       The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily.
     The free-born forest found and kept them free,
       The freest she that ever gazed on glass;
       The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,

       The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,
     The future states of both are left to faith,

     The gallant cavaliers, who fought in vain

       The General Markow, who could thus evince
       The general who held him in command;
       The gentle girl and her attendant,—one
     The gentle Juan flourish'd, though at times
     The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.
     The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,
       The gentlemen that were the first to show
     The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,
     'The Georgian and her paramour,' replied
       The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,
     The ghost at least had done him this much good,
       The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.
     The ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul
       The ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! Ill
     The ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until
     The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,
       The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,
     The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,
     The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;
     The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,
     The gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke
     The glorious meed of popular applause,
       The glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,
     The goal is gain'd, we die, you know—and then—
     The goodliest soil of body and of mind.
     The good old gentleman had been detain'd
     The good old gentleman was quite aghast,
       The good old khan, who long had ceased to see
     The Gordian or the Geordi-an knot, whose strings
       The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.
     The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,
     The grand antithesis to great ennui,

     The greater their success the worse it proves,

       The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;
     The greatest number flesh hath ever known.
     The great success of Juan's education,
     The Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan's bed;
     The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance
     The groan, the roll in dust, the all-white eye
       The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
     The growing waters; it unmans one quite,
      The guests dropped in, the last but one, Her Grace,
     The guests were placed according to their roll,
     The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
     The gulf of rock yawns,—you can't gaze a minute
       The hand from burning underneath them placed,
       The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat
     The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees
     The hangings of the room were tapestry, made
       The happiest mortals even after dinner—
       The hardness by long habitude produced,
       The harper came, and tuned his instrument;
     The heap a moment more had made her tomb.
       The hearers of her case became repeaters,
     The heart asunder;—then, as more or lees
     The heart in an existence of its own,
     The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,
     The hearts of the heroic on a charge,
     The heart—which may be broken: happy they!
       (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),
       The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,
       The heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:
     The henna should be deeply dyed to make
           The Heracleidan blood might own.
             The heroic bosom beats no more!
           The heroic lay is tuneless now—
     The hero of this grand poetic riddle,
             The hero's harp, the lover's lute,
     The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,
       The high wind made the treble, and as bas
       The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;
     The history of divorces, which, though chequer'd,
     The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms
     The holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.
       The Honourable Mistresses and Misses?
       The hopes of all men, and of every nation;
     The horrid sin—and what 's still worse, the trouble.
     The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream
       The hour, as is the case with lively brains;
     The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.
     The House of Commons turn'd to a tax-trap—
     The humblest individual under heaven,
       The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!
     The hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,
     The huntsman's self relented to a grin,
       (The hypocrite!), will banish them like Marius,
     The illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art
       The imperial bride—and added, 'Let the boat
       The import of this diplomatic phrase,
     The inconvenience of civilisation
     The inflammation of his weekly bills.
     The innocence which happy childhood blesses,
       The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,
     The insults, too, of every servile glutton,
     The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?
     Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,
     Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder
       Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;
     Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began
       Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!
       Their bread as ministers and favourites (that 's
       Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a Jew;
       Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.
     Their chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty
     Their charity increased about their guest;
     Their chastity in these unhappy climes
     Their chiefs to order,—were all cut to pieces.
     Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled
     Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,
     Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;—
     Their column, though the Turkish batteries thunder'd
     Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
       Their country; and as traitors are abhorr'd
     Their Delhis mann'd some boats, and sail'd again,
     Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there
       Their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,
     Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent
       Their docile esquires also did the same,
     Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd
     Their duty was—for they were strong, and though
     Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.
     Their energy like life forms all their fame,
     Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their
       Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle
     Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,
     Their fee; but ere the water'd wheels may hiss hence,
       Their flanks;—but it is hardly worth my while
     Their folly in forgetting there are fools.
       Their friends from foes,—besides such things from haste
     Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
       Their fury being spent by its own shock,
     Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;
     Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,
       Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce
       Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,
     Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.
       Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed
     Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,
     Their images again as in a glass,
     Their intense souls, into each other pour'd,
     Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
     Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;
       Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,
     Their leader sang—and bounded to her song,
     Their lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or
     Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;
     Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,
       Their living freight was now reduced to four,
     Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
     Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode
     Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,
     Their loyal treason, renegado rigour,
     Their luckier votaries, till old age's tedium
     Their martial faces on the parapet,
     Their moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.
       Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,
       Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.
     Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill—
     Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ
       Their never knowing their own mind two days,
       Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
     Their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,
     Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,
     Their office; he took up an old newspaper;
     Their own protectors; nor was their surprise
       Their own true interests, which kings rarely know
       Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features
     Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,
     Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there
             Their place of birth alone is mute
       Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,
       Their plates—without it might be too much bending
     Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less
     Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,
       Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,'
     Their preservation would have been a miracle.
       Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:
     Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?
     Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame
     Their roar even with the Baltic's—so you be
     Their sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,
       Theirs being an unnatural situation,
       Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth
     Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable
       Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;
     Their sofa occupied three parts complete
       Their sort of half profession; for it grows
       Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,
     Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
       Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording
       Their station: there were valets, secretaries,
       Their stature, differing but in sex and years;
       Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
     Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,
     Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts
     Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;
        Their tender parents in their budding days,
     Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,
       Their tumble, I should turn the other way,
     Their union was a model to behold,
       Their veil and petticoat—Alas! to dwell
       Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
     Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;
     Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,
            Their walls, if they said nay;
       Their way through virtue's primrose paths of snows;
     Their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works
     Their work even by the way in which he trode.
       Their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to
       The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,
                     THE ISLES OF GREECE.
           The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
     The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,
     (The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').
     The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,
       The kindest may be taken as a test.
     The king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,
     The king himself had cheapen'd it, but thought
     The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,
     The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques
       The Ladies Scilly, Busey;—Miss Eclat,
     The ladies—some rouged, some a little pale—
       The ladies,—who by no means had been bred
     The ladies with more moderation mingled
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville,
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville;
     The Lady Adeline Amundeville
     The Lady Adeline, as soon 's she saw
     The Lady Adeline resolved to take
     The Lady Adeline, right honourable;
     The Lady Adeline's serene severity
     The lady and her lover, left alone,
     The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade
     The lady rising up with such an air
     The lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires
     The lady watch'd her lover—and that hour
       The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,
     The land appear'd a high and rocky coast,
       The landed and the monied speculation?
     The lands on either side are his; the ship
     The languages, especially the dead,
     The 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!'
     The lash to Baba:—but her grand resource
       The last, if late accounts be accurate,
     (The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,
       The last indeed 's infallibly the case:
       The last is apt the former to accuse
     The last of these was never much the fashion,
     The last 's a miracle, and such was reckon'd,
     The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,
     The last thin petticoats were vanish'd, gone
     "The last time was——"—"I pray," said Adeline—
       The last war—much the same in Portugal;
       The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:
     The last year to the new transfers its hoards;
     The latest, Juan with his virgin face.
     The latter worse used of the two we 've seen—
       The law of all around her; to fulfill
     The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,
     The lawyer and the critic but behold
       The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,
       The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,
     The lawyers in the study; and in air
     The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,
     The learned tutors whom for him she hired,
       The least glance better understood than words,
       (The least of which would set ten poets raving);
     The letter of the prince to the same marshal
       The letter open with an air which posed
     The lightest being the safest: at a distance
     The light that through the Gothic windows shone.
       The limb which it adorn'd its only mould;
     The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,
     The lisp of children, and their earliest words.
     The list grows long of live and dead pretenders
     The 'little boatman' and his 'Peter Bell'
     The little fellow really look'd quite hearty,
       The little I have said may serve to show
     The little Leila, with her orient eyes,
     The little Turk refused to be converted.
     The liver is the lazaret of bile,
     The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,
     The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages;
     The London winter and the country summer
     The London winter 's ended in July—
     The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
     The longings of the cannibal arise
     The long year link'd with heavy day on day,
       The loss of love, the treachery of friends,
     The lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,
     The loudest wit I e'er was deafen'd with.
     The loveliest, chastest, best, but—quite a fool.
       The loveliest oligarchs of our gynocracy;
     The love of higher things and better days;
     The love of offspring 's nature's general law,
     The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,
     The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
     The luck of finding every body solvent.
     The lurking bias, be it truth or error,
     The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,
     The madden'd Turks their city still dispute.
       The magic of her Grace's talisman,
     The main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay
     The major part of such appellants go
     The major part of them had long been wived,
     The 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!'
     The man in all the rest might be confest,
       The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)
     The mansion's self was vast and venerable,
     The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel
     The man was well nigh dead, ere men begun
       The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith!
       The marriage state, the best or worst of any)
     The married ones to save the virgins trouble.
     The match was lit too soon, and no assistance
       The matron frown'd: 'Why so?'—'For fear of ghosts,'
     The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm
     The mellow autumn came, and with it came
       The men within the boat, and in this guise
     The merchandise was served in the same way,
       The mercy he had granted oft abused,
       The middle-aged to make the day more short;
     The milliners who furnish 'drapery Misses'
       The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,
     The mind is lost in mighty contemplation
       The mischief, after all, could not be great,
     The Missal too (it was the family Missal)
       The Misses bridled, and the matrons frown'd;
     The mob stood, and as usual several score
       The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;
       The moment after he politely ends
       The moment he has sent his fools away.
       The moment of the general consternation,
       The moments when we gather from a glance
     The moment, till too late to come again.
     The monde, exactly as they ought to paint:
     The moon breaks, half unveil'd each further charm,
     The moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.
       The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,
     The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:
       The more so in obtaining our own ends;
     The more 's the pity, with her face and figure.
       The more 's the reason why you ought to stay.
     The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still
       The morning came, and breakfast, tea and toast,
       The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim—
     The mortal and the marble still at strife,
     The Moslem orphan went with her protector,
     The Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;
     The most by ready cash—but all have prices,
     The most imperative of sovereign spells,
     The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.
     The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
           The mountains look on Marathon—
     The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,
       The movables were prodigally rich:
       The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen
       Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on
     Themselves on innocent tantalisation,
     Themselves to unity, like this of mine.
     The Muses upon Sion's hill must ramble
     The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.
       The musico is but a crack'd old basin,
       The mystery of this rupture of their rest;
       The mystical usurper of the mind—
     Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
     The name and quality of his new patron,
     The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
     Then ask'd her Grace what news were of the duke of late?
     Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw
     Then being taken by the tail—a taking
     Then broke his packet, to see what was in 't,
       Then by degrees recall'd his energies,
     Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,
     Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,
     Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears
     Then changed like to a bow that 's bent, and then
     Then comes 'the tug of war;'—'t will come again,
     Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.
     Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!
     The negro Baba help'd a little too,
       The Negroes and is worth a million fighters;
     The negroes more philosophy display'd,—
     The Nestors of the sporting generation,
       The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.
       The new world would be nothing to the old,
     The next are 'only children', as they are styled,
     The next are such as are not doomed to lose
       The next of perils, though I place it sternest,
     The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,
     The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;
     Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.
     Then for accomplishments of chivalry,
       Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar
          Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;
     Then having settled his marine affairs,
     Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,
     Then held that 'high official situation.'
     Then Henry turn'd to Juan, and address'd
     'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'—'Hold!'
     Then, if she hath not that serene decline
     Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut
       The night before, but being sick of shaking,
     The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,
     The night (I sing by night—sometimes an owl,
       The nightly muster and the silent march
       The nights and days most people can remember
     The night was as before: he was undrest,
     The night was dark, and the thick mist allow'd
       The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
     Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,
     Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,
       Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see
     The noble guests, assembled at the Abbey,
             The nobler and the manlier one?
     The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
     The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,
     Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,
     Then out it came at length, that to Dudu
     Then recollecting the whole empress, nor
     Then rising haughtily he glanced around,
       Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,
     Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell—
       Then sees your heart wreck'd, with an inward scoffing.
       Then she was given to charity and pity,
       Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,
     Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,
     Then slacken'd it, which is the march most caused
     Then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,
       Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
       Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say
       Then their relations, who made matters worse.
     Then there 's more merit in his self-denial.
     Then there 's my gentle Euphues, who, they say,
     Then there 's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,
       Then there's the vulgar trick of those d——d damages! !
     Then there was God knows what 'a l'Allemande,'
     Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.
       Then there was small-talk ready when required;
     Then there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;—
     Then there were foreigners of much renown,
     Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:
     Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
     Then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp
     Then turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood
       Then turn'd unto the stars for loftier rays.
     The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.
       Then underneath, and in the very same
     'Then up with me!'—But Juan answer'd, 'Look
     Then was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung
     Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew
     The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;
       The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be
     The ocean of eternity: the roar
     The ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,
     The ocean when its yeasty war is waging
       The Oda, in a general commotion:
     The odds are that he finds a handsome urn
     The old archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave
     The oldest thing on record, and yet new!
     The old hen by running headlong to the water.
     The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,
     The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,
       Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,
     The one is winning, and the other losing.
     The only dance which teaches girls to think,
     The only gentlemen seem I and you;
             The only hope of courage dwells;
       The only mischief was, it came too late;
       The only sort of pleasure which requites.
       The only thing of this sort ever seen
     The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
     The only time when much success is needed:
     The only truth that yet has been confest
     The only two that in my recollection
     The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er
     The ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.
     The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had
     The other evening ('t was on Friday last)—
     The other father had a weaklier child,
     The other female's dress was not unlike,
     The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,
     The others pouting at the matron's preference
       The other, thanking him for this excess
       The other; that 's to say, the clergy, who
       The other two are women, and the third
     The outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.
     The owl his anthem, where the silenced quire
       The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,
     The pale contended with the purple rose,
       The paper was right easy to peruse;
     The Parcae then cut short the further spinning
       The Parliament and all the other houses;
       The party a slight glance, then said, 'I have heard
     The party might consist of thirty-three
       The party we have touch'd on were the guests:
     The passage you so often have explored—
     The 'passee' and the past; for good society
       The passion which made Solomon a zany.
       The passion which still rages as before—
     The past still welcome as the present thought.
     The path is through perplexing ways, and when
     The paths, o'er which the far festoon entwines
       The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers
       The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;
     The peerage, to a mansion very fine;
       The people by and by will be the stronger:
       The people's awe and admiration raising;
     The phantom of her frolic Grace—Fitz-Fulke!
       The phrase is Shakspeare's, and not misapplied:
     The pins were placed sufficiently, but not
     The pious metals most in requisition
     The plan at present 's simply in concoction,
       The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
       The pleasant riddles of futurity—
     The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
     The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
     The poets of arithmetic are they
       The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats
     The politicians, in a nook apart,
       The poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.
       The poor priest was reduced to common sense,
     The population there so spreads, they say
     The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,
     The portion of this world which I at present
       The postboys have no reason to disparage
     The power of art was turn'd to nothing, for
     The praise of persecution; gaze again
     The precious porcelain of human clay,
     The precipice she stood on was immense,
       The present century was growing blind
     The present culprit was extremely pale,
       The present poem—of—I know not what—
       The present weather would be much more rainy—
     The present, with their common-place costume.
       The price would speedily repay its worth in
     The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,
       The priest instructs, and so our life exhales,
     'The prima donna, though a little old,
     The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,
     The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;
     'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor
       The prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent
       The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.
     The prospect and their morals: and besides,
     The public approbation I expect,
       The public buildings and the private too,
       The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
       The Public knew no more than does this rhyme;
       The public mind,—so few are the elect;
     The pumps, and there were four feet water found.
     The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance
     The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin
     The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet
     The quantity of good she did 's unknown,
     The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought
     The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,
     The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;
       The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,
     The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.
       The rampart higher than you 'd wish to hang:
       The reader; but 't would not be hard to bring
     The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.
     The real portrait of the highest tribe?
     There also was of course in Adeline
     There also was——the sinner that I am!
     There also were some Irish absentees.
     There also were two wits by acclamation,
       The real sufferings of their she condition?
     The reason 's obvious; if there 's an eclat,
       The reason why is easy to determine:
     There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl
       There being no such profusion in the North
     There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung
     There cannot be much conversation there.
     There captives led in triumph droop the eye,
       There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,
     There, couch'd all snugly on his pillow's nook,
       The red grape in the sunny lands of song,
     The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade
     Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan
     Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,
     Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I
     Therefore I would solicit free discussion
     Therefore the present piece of natural history
       There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
     The regimental surgeon could not cure
     The regularity of my design
     There had not been one Shakspeare and Voltaire,
       There have been and are heroes who begun
     There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,
       There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt
     There is a commonplace book argument,
     There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
     There is a difference, says the song, 'between
     There is a flower call'd 'Love in Idleness,'
       There is a move set down for joy or sorrow
     There is a narrowness in such a notion,
     There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,
       There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,
     There is a sort of unexprest concern,
    'There is a tide in the affairs of men
     There is a tide in the affairs of women
     There is but one superb menagerie.
     There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,
     There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.
     'There is the closet, there the toilet, there
     There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
       There lies the rub—and this they are but weak in.
     There lies the thing we love with all its errors
       There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.
       There mails fast flying off like a delusion;
     There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells
       There might arise some pouting petty care
     There might be one more motive, which makes two;
     There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then
       There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;
     There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is
     There poets find materials for their books,
       There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,
     There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,
     There 's also nightly, to the uninitiated,
     There 's doubtless something in domestic doings
     There seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding
     (There 's fame) young partridge fillets, deck'd with truffles.
       There 's fortune even in fame, we must allow.
     There 's glory again for you, gentle reader! All
     There she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;
       There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.
       There 's little left but to be bored or bore.
     There 's little strange in this, but something strange is
     There 's more than one edition, and the readings
     There 's music in all things, if men had ears:
       There 's music in the gushing of a rill;
     There 's music in the sighing of a reed;
     There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
     There 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain
     There 's not a meteor in the polar sky
       There 's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:
     There 's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,
       There 's nothing in the world like etiquette
     There 's nothing so becoming to the face.
     There 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw
       There 's nothing women love to dabble in
       There 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:
     There 's nought in this bad world like sympathy:
     There 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
     There solitude, we know, has her full growth in
       (There 's one, at least, is very fond of this);
     There 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,
     There 's only one slight difference between
       There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need—
     There 's pretty picking in those 'petits puits.'
     There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,
     There 's something of antipathy, as 't were,
     There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink
       The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;
     The rest had been reform'd, replaced, or sunk,
     There still are many rainbows in your sky,
     The restless Titan hiccups in his den.
       The rest of all that tribe; with here and there
     The rest—save here and there some richer one,
     The rest were jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills;
     There surely will be little doubt with some
             There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
     There the large olive rains its amber store
     There the still varying pangs, which multiply
     There, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)
       There wanted but the loss of this to wean
     There wanted but this requisite to swell
     There was a country girl in a close cap
     There was a depth of feeling to embrace
     There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,
     There was a goodly match too, to be run
     There was a goodly 'soupe a la bonne femme,'
     There was a man, if that he was a man,
     There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic
       There was an end of Ismail—hapless town!
     There was an Irish lady, to whose bust
     There was a picture-dealer who had brought
     There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,
     There was a self-will even in her small feet,
     There was a something in his turn of limb,
     There was a something which bespoke command,
       There was a way to end their strife, although
     There was awe in the homage which she drew;
     There was deep silence in the chamber: dim
     There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,
       There was enthusiasm and much applause,
     There was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;
     There was just then a kind of a discussion,
     There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;
     There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,
     There was much bustle too, and preparation
     There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.
     There was no end unto the things she bought,
     There was no great disparity of years,
     There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
     There was no mighty reason to be pleased;
     There was not now a luggage boy but sought
     There was no want of lofty mirrors, and
     There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,
       There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;
     There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
       There was small leisure for superfluous sin;
     There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
     There was the Duke of Dash, who was a—duke,
     There was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,
     There was the purest Platonism at bottom
     There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,
     There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,
     There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly
     There were but two exceptions to this keen
     There were four Honourable Misters, whose
     There were some country wags too—and, alas!
     There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,
       There were some massy members of the church,
       There were some other reasons: the first was,
       There were the six Miss Rawbolds—pretty dears!
     There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,
     There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage
     There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,
     There winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,
       There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;
     (The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes
     The ridicules of people in all places—
       The river from the lake, all bluely dash'd
       The rosy flood of twilight's sky admired;—
       'The royal game of Goose,' as I may say,
     The ruby glass that shakes within his hand
     The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound
     The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild
     The rugged tree unto the summer wind,
     The ruling passion, such as marble shows
       The Russ flotilla getting under way;
       The Russian army upon this occasion,
     The Russian batteries were incomplete,
       The Russian officer for life was lamed,
     The Russians, having built two batteries on
     The Russians now were ready to attack:
     The sable Friar in his solemn hood.
       The sack and sea had settled all in time,
     The sacraments have been reduced to two
     The sailors ate him, all save three or four,
     The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.
       The salmi, the consomme, the puree,
     The same, Katinka, until by and by;
     The same self-interest, with a different leaning).
       The same things cannot always be admired,
       The same things change their names at such a rate;
     (The same who physick'd Peter) found the tick
       The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,
       The scanty but right-well thresh'd ears of truth;
     The scars of his old wounds were near his new,
       The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,
     The scenes like Catherine's boudoir at threescore,
     The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.
           The Scian and the Teian muse,
       The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
       The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild—
       The sea-coal fires the 'earliest of the year;'
       The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight,
       The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'
       These amiable descriptions from the scribes,
     These are beneath the canopy of heaven,
       These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,
     The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,
       The season, rather than to winter drear,
     These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,
       The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:
     The second had his cheek laid open; but
       The second may be sadly done or gaily;
     The second object was to profit by
     The secret cavern of this lurking treasure—
       These don't express one half what I should say:
     These few short years make wondrous alterations,
     These first twelve books are merely flourishes,
     These forty days' advantage of her years—
     These freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads
     These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
       These last had disappear'd—a loss to art:
     These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,
     The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
     The sensual for a short time but connects us,
       The sentimental boasts to be unmoved;
     These Oriental writings on the wall,
       These phrases of refinement I must borrow
     These quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst—
     These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom
     'The Seraskier is knock'd upon the head,
       The serious Angles in the eloquence
     The servants all were getting drunk or idling,
     The servile and the vain, such names will be
     These seals upon her wax made no impression,
     These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
     The seventh day, and no wind—the burning sun
     The seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.
     These were advantages: and then he thought—
     These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,
     These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,
     The shade of Buonaparte's noble daring?-
       The shadow pass'd away—but where? the hall
     The sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,
     The ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'
     The ship was evidently settling now
     The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,
     The shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,
       The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee—
     The show of virtue even in the vitiated—
     The shrill cicadas, people of the pine,
       The shudder which runs naturally through
     The sights he was accustom'd to behold,
     The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,
       The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun
     The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
       The silvery bell rang, not for 'dinner ready,
     The simple olives, best allies of wine,
     The singeing of a single inky whisker.
     The single ladies wishing to be double,
       The Sinking Fund's unfathomable sea,
     The situation seems still form'd for fame—
       The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;
       The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;
       The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to fame,
       The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,—
     The soil of the green province he had wasted,
     The soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,
     The solitude of passing his own door
     The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
       The song was silent, and the dance expired:
     The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
       The sort of sound we echo with a tear,
     The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,
     The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.
     The sound than sense)—beside all these pretences
     The sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.
     The Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,
     The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,
     The spectre huntsman of Onesti's line,
     The spirit in the end will have its way.
       The spirit of these walls?'—'In truth not I.'
       The spots which were her realms for evermore;
       The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,
     The spray into their faces as they splash'd.
     The spring gush'd through grim mouths of granite made,
     The squires familiarly formal, and
     The starry darkness round her like a girdle
     The stars from out the sky, than not be free
       The stars, I own my telescope is dim:
       The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,
     The statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer—ward
     The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move
     The story scarcely pass'd a single lip—
       The stranger stripling may remain with me;
     The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly
     The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.
     The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties
     The strictest in chronology and virtue
     The stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.
     The struggle to be pilots in a storm?
     The sufferers, be't in heart or intellect,
     The suit he thought most suitable to each
       The sum of their sensations to a second:
     The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,
     The sun himself was scarce more free from specks
       The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
     The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign
     The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
     The sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.
     The sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from
     The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,
     The superstratum which will overlay us.
       The supper too discuss'd, the dames admired,
       The supplicator being an amateur;
     The surest way for ladies and for books
     The surgeon, as there was no other fee,
       The surgeon had his instruments, and bled
       The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;
       The tables, most of ebony inlaid
     The talent and good humour he display'd,
       The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:
     The tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,
     The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
     The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,
     'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,
       The tenor; these two hated with a hate
       The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder'd;
       The theme, half credited the strange tradition;
       The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss
     The things down, said, 'Incense me, and I call
       The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took
     The third, in columns two, attack'd by water.
     The third is still more difficult to stand to;
     The third sort to be noted in our chronicle
       The third, the usual Origin of Evil;
     The third time, after a still longer pause,
     The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.
       'The time is out of joint,'—and so am I;
       The time may come when you may hear me too;
     The time must come, when both alike decay'd,
       The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft
     The time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd
     Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;
     The tocsin of the soul—the dinner-bell.
     The tones, the feeling, and the execution,
     The topic 's tender, so shall be my phrase—
     The 'tout ensemble' of his movements wore a
     The town was enter'd: first one column made
     The town was enter'd. Oh eternity!-
     The town was taken—whether he might yield
     The train might reach a quarter of a mile:
       The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd
       The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd—all 's known—
     The troops, already disembark'd, push'd on
     The trouble that they gave, their immorality,
       The True Believers:—and her infant brow
       The true effect, and so we had better not
     The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb—
     The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,
       The truth in masquerade; and I defy
     The truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:
       The tumulus—of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be

       The Turkish fire, and aided by their own
       The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall
       The Turks at first pretended to have scamper'd,
     The Turks, behind the traverses and flanks
     The Turks do well to shut—at least, sometimes—
     The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row
     The 'tu' 's too much,—but let it stand,—the verse
       The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,
       The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,
       The twilight glow which momently grew less,
     The two first feelings ran their course complete,
           The tyrant of the Chersonese
       The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had
     The umbrage of the wood so cool and dun
       The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance
       The unexpected death of some old lady
       The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet
     The unusual quickness of these common changes.
     The upper border, richly wrought, display'd,
     The usual hirsute seasons which destroy,

     The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
     The vasty deep,' to whom you may exclaim,
       The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care
     The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)
       The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,
     The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings
       The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,
     The very best of vineyards is the cellar.
       The very Botany Bay in moral geography;
     The very cannon, deafen'd by the din,
     The very clerks,—those somewhat dirty springs
     The very generations of the dead
     The very instant, till the change that cast
     The very lowest find out an inferior,
     The very model of a chamberlain—
     The very place where wicked people go.
     The very powerful parson, Peter Pith,
     The very servants puzzling how to hand
     The very shadow of true Truth would shut
       The very Suicide that pays his debt
     The very tendon which is most acute
     The very thing which every body feels,
       The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.
       The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd
       The Virgin Mother of the God-born Child,
     The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,
     The voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay
     The voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once
     The vulgarest tool that tyranny could want,
     The walls were won, but 't was an even bet
       The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity
     The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters
       The water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,
     The water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,
     The waters, and repentance for past sinning
       The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;
     The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.
     The ways that lead there, be they near or far,
     The way which they had never trod before,
     The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.
       The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):
     The web of these tarantulas each day
       The welcome stall to the o'erlabour'd steer;
     The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
     The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,
     The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought
     The whole court look'd immediately most sweet,
     The whole court melted into one wide whisper,
       The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.
       The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,
     The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!
     The whole together is what I could wish
       The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,
       The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,
       The wild sensation, unto her a new one:
     The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
     The wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,
       The wind is winged from one point of heaven,
     The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.
       The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,
     The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave
     The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.
       The wind was fair, the water passing rough:
     The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he
     The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,
     The wits watch'd every loophole for their art,
     The women much divided—as is usual
     The women pardon'd all except her face.
       The women up, because, in sad reality,
     The women with their hair about their ears
     The wondrous hideousness of those small men,
     The woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood
     The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,
       The world (as, since that history less polite
     The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
     The world by experience rather than by lecture,
     The world gave ground before her bright array;
       The world in which a man was born? 'Alas!
     The world is all before me—or behind;
     The world is full of orphans: firstly, those
     The world is full of strange vicissitudes,
     The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.
       The world, not the world's masters, will decide,
     The worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste
     The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,
     The world to gaze upon those northern lights
     The world upon the whole is worth the assertion
     The world was not for them, nor the world's art
     The world, which at the worst 's a glorious blunder—
       The world will find thee after many days.'
     The worst of all was, that in their condition,
     The worst of tempests and the best of battles
       The worst to know it:—when the mountains rear
     The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;
       The wounds they richly merited, and shriek
       The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
     They accuse me—Me—the present writer of
     They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.
     They all alike admired their new connection.
       They all found out as few, or fewer, specks
     They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.
     They almost lost their way, and had to pick it—
     They also gave a petticoat apiece,
     They also lie too—under a mistake.
     They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,
     They and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left
       They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
     They are but bad pilots when the weather 's rough,
       They are put on as easily as a hat,
     They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,
       They are so much intertwisted with the earth;
       They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
     They are wrong—that 's not the way to set about it;
     They are young, but know not youth—it is anticipated;
       They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,
     They blew up in the middle of the river,
     They blush, and we believe them; at least I
     They bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring,
       They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;
       They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;
       They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:
     They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.
     They changed from room to room—but all forgot—
     They could not even glean the slightest splinters
     They could not look more rosy than before.
       They could not rescue him although so close,
     They counted thirty, crowded in a space
       They dared not take it in for all the breeze:
     They did their best to modify their case,
     They differ as wine differs from its label,
     They do not much contribute to his glory.
       They drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws
     They either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,
     They err'd, as aged men will do; but by
       They err—'t is merely what is call'd mobility,
     They fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,
     They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,
       They felt no terrors from the night, they were
     They felt the freshness of its growing green,
     They fill the canvas up—and 'verbum sat.'
       They follow'd close behind their sable guide,
     They form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,
       They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,
     They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;
     They found on their return the self-same welcome,
     They found that he had fought beneath their banner.
     They furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,
     They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
     They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour
     They generally have some only son,
     They glared upon each other—all was done,
     They grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,
       They had but little baggage at their backs,
     They had not spoken; but they felt allured,
       They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there
       They haggled, wrangled, swore, too—so they did!
     They hate a murderer much less than a claimant
     They hate me, not I them.—and here we 'll pause.
             They have a king who buys and sells;
     They have at hand a blooming glut of brides.
     They heard next day—that in the Dardanelles,
     They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,
     They hired him, though to hear him you 'd believe
     They honour'd such determined scorn of life.
     They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!
     They journey'd on through Poland and through Warsaw,
     They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,
     They knew not what to think of such a freak.
       They knew not where, being carried by the stream
       They knew not where nor what they were about;
     They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar
     They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,
       They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;
     They little knew, or might have sympathised,
       They little think what mischief is in hand;
       They lived respectably as man and wife,
       They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,
       They lived together, as most people do,
       They live upon the love of life, and bear
       They 'll never find it out, unless I own
     They 'll only make mistakes about the fair,
     They look'd like persons being led to sentence,
       They look'd so little, did strong things at times—
     They look'd upon the Muscovite flotilla,
     They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow
     They look upon each other, and their eyes
       They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;
     They made a fire,—but such a fire as they
     They made a most superior mess of broth,
     They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.
       They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
       They mean to scold, and very often do;
     They moved like stars united in their spheres,
     They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,
       They must wait several weeks before a mass
     They naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'
       They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air
     They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.
     They only add them all in an appendix,
     They open'd windows, gazing if the ground
       They parted for the present—these to await,
       They pass'd as such things do, for superstition
       They perish'd, until wither'd to these few,
     They placed him o'er the women as a scout)
       They pleased to make or take him for; and their
       They put beholders in a tender taking;
     They ran the boat for shore,—and overset her.
     They reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front door
       They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.
       They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack
     They 're right; our days are too brief for affording
       They run before the wind through high seas breaking;
     They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;
       They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:
     They say his system 't is in vain to batter,
     They say no more of Death or of the Lady.
       They say so (Bryant says the contrary):
       They say you like it too—'t is no great wonder.
       They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,
     They separated at an early hour;
       They shall appear before your curious eyes,
     They should at least have fifty rubles round,
     They should have lived together deep in woods,
     They should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,
     They smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong
       They smile still more, and then there intervene
       They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
       They sometimes also get a little tired
     They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,
     They spoke by signs—that is, not spoke at all;
     They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,
     They stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.
     They talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon its
       They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
     'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
     They thought that in such perils, more than chance
       They thus address'd—and Lambro's visage fell—
     They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.
     They took it up when my days grew more mellow,
     They took the bastion, which the Seraskier
     They tried the pumps again, and though before
     They trod as upon necks; and to complete
     They turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,
     They turn out melodrames or pantomimes.
     They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don't;
     They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,
     They were all summer: lightning might assail
     They were alone, but not alone as they
     They were alone once more; for them to be
     They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb—
     They were not made in the real world to fill
     They were relations, and for them he had a
     They were so soft and beautiful, and rife
     They will destroy a face which mortal thought
     They wonder'd how a young man so absurd
     They wonder'd how Gulbeyaz, too, could be
     They won't lay out their money on the dead—
     They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.
     They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.
     They write, and for what end; but, note or text,
     They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher
     Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,
     Thine ear, if it should reach—and now rhymes wander
     Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
     Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,
     Think how the joys of reading a Gazette
     Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!
       Thinking unutterable things; he threw
     Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all—
     Think of the Thunderer's falling down below
     Think'st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise
       Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
       Think what it is to be in your old age
           Think ye he meant them for a slave?
     Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
       Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;
     Thirdly, commence not with the end—or, sinning
     Thirdly, that 'Juan had more brain than beard,
     This awkward business without harm to others,
     This being the case, may show us what Fame is:
     This by his heart, his rival by his head.
       This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.
     This chieftain—somehow would not yield at all:
     This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.'
     This circumstance may serve to give a notion
     This compliment, which drew all eyes upon
       This day; and watching, witching, condescending
     This dialogue; for he who answer'd knew
     This feeling 't is not easy to express,
     This fellow, being six foot high, could raise
       This great philosopher was thus instilling
       This he (as far as I can understand) meant.
     This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
     This he discreetly kept in the background,
       This he express'd half smiling and half serious;
       This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting
     This I could prove beyond a single doubt,
       This I must leave sultanas to decide:
       This is a fact and no poetic fable—
       This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:
     This is in others a factitious state,
     This is no bull, although it sounds so; for
     This is the age of oddities let loose,
     This is the literary lower empire,
     This is the patent-age of new inventions
     This is the way physicians mend or end us,
       This is true criticism, and you may kiss—
       This I will say—my reasons are my own—
     This labyrinth of females, and each station
       This liberty is a poetic licence,
     This licence is to hope the reader will
       This long parenthesis: I could not shut
     This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,
     This massy portal stood at the wide close
     This may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty—
       This may be superstition, weak or wild,
     This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
     (This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,
       This modern Amazon and queen of queans;
     This monstrous tale had probably its source
     This morning rather spent less time upon 't;
       This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things
       This narrative is not meant for narration,
     This noble personage began to look
     This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
       (This old song and new simile holds good),
     This paradise of pleasure and ennui.
     This passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk
     This poem will become a moral model.
     This pretty gentleman within the closet:
     This revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning.
     This savour'd of this world; but his hand shook—
     This scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.
     This secret charge on Juan, to display
     (This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
     This simile enough for Ajax, Juan
     This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,
     This sort of adoration of the real
       This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;
     This special honour was conferr'd, because
     This spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold,
       This story is not moral, first, I pray,
     This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring
     This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer
     This subject quote; as it would be schismatic
       This they must bear with and perhaps much more.
     This, though not large, was one of the most rich.
     This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan—
     This valiant man kill'd all the Turks he met,
     This was an awkward test, as Juan found,
     This was an easy matter with a man
     This was a truth to us extremely trite;
     This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
     This was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,
     This was Potemkin—a great thing in days
     This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings—
       This way of writing will appear exotic;
     This weakness in a few hours, and recover.
     This we pass over. We will also pass
     This were the worst desertion:—renegadoes,
     This—when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.
     This works a world of sentimental woe,
     This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.
       Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved
     Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,
       Those became one who soon were to be two,
       Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;
     Those captive soothers of a captive's hours.
       Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?
       Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove—
     Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain
     Those gay recesses:—many a precious stone
       Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt
       Those holier mysteries which the wise and just
       Those honourable scars which brought him fame;
     Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,
       Those little glitterers of the London night;
     Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
     Those movements, those improvements in our bodies
     Those navigators must be able seamen
       Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;
     Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.
       Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in
     Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:
     Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.
       Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
     Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,
     Those vegetables of the Catholic creed
     Those who catch cold in 'shadows of Death's valley.'
     Those who dislike to look upon a fray,
       Those who in counties have great land resources
     Those who will leave you of no sex at all.

     Through fifty victories to shame or fame—
     Through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,
     Through Groves, so call'd as being void of trees
       Through his means and the church's might be paved.

     Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago;
     Thus in the East they are extremely strict,

     Thus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better
       Thus Julia said—and thought so, to be sure;
     Thus lived—thus died she; never more on her
       Thus most appropriately has been shown
     Thus much however I may add,—her years
     Thus much she view'd an instant and no more,—

     Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds
     Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.
     Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties
     Thy plagues, thy famines, thy physicians, yet tick,

     'T is a grand sight from off 'the Giant's Grave
       'T is a 'great moral lesson' they are reading.
     'T is all the same to me; I 'm fond of yielding,
     'T is also of some moment to the latter:
     'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
       'T is also subject to the double danger
       'T is always best to take things upon trust.
       ('Tis an old Norman name, and to be found
     'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
     'T is as a snowball which derives assistance
     'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,
       'T is bad, and may be better—all men's lot:
     'T is beautiful to see a matron bring
       'T is being too epic, and I must cut down
     'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,
     'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen
           'T is but the living who are dumb.
     'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.
       'T is fine to see them scattering refusals
     'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey—
       'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
     'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
       'T is Lambro—'t is my father! Kneel with me—
     'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign
       'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:

     'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell
     ''T is not,' said Juan, 'for my present doom
     'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.
       'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,

     'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw
     'T is true there be some bitters with the sweets,

       To ascertain the atmospheric state,
       To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,
     To ask him awkward questions on the way
     To ask the reverend person what he wanted.
     To attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh
     Tobacco on a little carpet;—Troy
     To bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks.
       To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows
     To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,
       To be a lovely and a fearful thing;

     To beg his pardon when I err a bit.
     To beg the beggar, who could not rain back
       To be her happiness, and whom she deem'd
       To be impaled, or quarter'd as a dish
       To be Italians, as they were in fact;

     'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'
       To be produced when brought up to the test.
       To be pursued as food for inanition),
     To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,
       To be so being; in a gushing stream
       To be the first of what we used to call
       To be the most remote from common use,
       To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,
       To bid men come, and go, and come again—
       To bode him no great good, he deprecated
     To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.
     To break the rules by bringing one's own bride
       To breathe destruction on its winding way,
       To bring the other three here was absurd:
       To bring what was a jest to a serious end:
       To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,—
       To build a college, or to found a race,
     To build up common things with common places.
     To burn a town which never did them harm.
     To calculators when they count on woman.
     To call men love-begotten or proclaim
       To call them back into their separate cages,
     To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.
     To colour up his rays from your despatches.
     To come between mine epic and its index.
       To come off handsomely in that regard.
     To constitute a reader; there must go
     To corps, the greater part of which were corses.
       To critics, or to hail the setting sun
     To cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near
     To cutting short their hopes of having any?
     To deem, as a most logical conclusion,
     To deem the woods shall be our home at last
     To 'do at Rome as Romans do,' a piece
     To do not much less damage than the table.
     To double even the sweetness of a flower.

     To do with the transactions of my hero,

       To early risers after a long chase,
     To eat the head of his arch-enemy
       To educate—ye youth of Europe—you by!
       To end or to begin with; the next grand
       To entertain, this autumn, a select

       To expound their vain and visionary gleams.
     To eye or heart—it is the people's trust.
     To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,
           To feel at least a patriot's shame,
     To feel for none is the true social art
     To feel, in friendless palaces, a home
       To feel that flattery which attracts the proud
     To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,
     To females of perspicuous comprehensions,
     To find how very badly she selected.
       To find our children running restive—they

       To find our way to Marmora without boats,
     To find so much good company invited.
     To find three perfect pipes of the third sex.
     To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.
     To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;
     To fly from, malgre all which people say
     To follow him beyond the drawing-room:
     To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.
       To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,
       To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),
       To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,
       To frighten them into capitulation;
     To furnish matter for some future Livy
       To furnish matter for their moral gibing;
     To gather to a somewhat large amount, he

     To get up part of the cargo, and what not;
     'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'
     To give some rebel Pacha a cravat;
     To—God knows where—for no one else can know.
     To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.
     To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.
       To hail her with the apostrophe—'O thou!'
     To hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng.
     To have, when the original is dust,
     'To hear and to obey' had been from birth
       To hear debates whose thunder roused (not rouses)
     'To hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,
       To hear new words, and to repeat them; but
       To heave into the deep with those before,
       To heaving back the portal folds: it scared
     To her, as 'twere, the kind of being sent,
       To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,—
       To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
     To him, and I should hope to most. The thirst
       To him it was Elysium to be there;
     To him whose breeding matches with his quality.
     To hinder him from growing still more pallid.
     To hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.'
     To hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.
     To hint that he is coming up this way.'
     To his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,
     To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,
       To his memory—and two or three young misses
       To his own circumstances, there might lie
       To history, tradition, and to facts,
     To his Tunis correspondents, save one man
     To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.
       To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
     To hold some sinecures he wish'd abolish'd,
       To Homer's Iliad, since it drew to Troy
       To hunt our errors up with a good grace?
       To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,
       To introduce a bon-mot head and ears;
       To irrigate the dryness of decline;
     To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,
     To Jack howe'er this gave but slight concern:
     To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
     To jest upon such themes in many a sally.
       To jest, you 'll choose some other theme just now,
     To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.
       To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:
     To Juan, who though not much used to pray,
     To Juan, who was nearest him, address'd
       To keep extremes from meeting, when once set
       To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
     To keep one creed's a task grown quite
       To keep our holy beacons always bright,
       To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
     To keep the wheels going of the higher class,
     To kill, and generals turn it into jest.
     To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave
     To kiss them all at once from North to South.
       'To know that nothing could be known;' a pleasant
     To last—of all connections the most steady,
     To laugh at all things—for I wish to know
       To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;
     Told of their sires, a tomb in every tree.
       To lean on for support in any way;
     To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,
     To leave the parties to themselves, forsooth—
       To leave together this imprudent pair,
     To lengthen fetters by another fixed
     To life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,
     To like, though I have been seven years in Italy,
       To like too readily, or too high bred
     To live with him forever were too much;
       To lodge there when a war broke out, according
     To lose by one month's frost some twenty years
     To lose itself when the old world grows dull,
     To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,
       To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;
       To lose those best months in a sweaty city,
     To love again, and be again undone.
     To love, there are those things which words name senses;
     To love too much has been the only art
     To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:
           To make a new Thermopylae!
     To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,
     To make a twilight in, just as Sol's heat is
     To make each correspondent a new debtor.
     To make him prisoner, was also dish'd:
       To make his little wild Asiatic tame,
     To make men happy, or to keep them so'
       To make such puppets of us things below),
     To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.
     To make the nuptial couch a 'Bed of Ware.'
     To make us understand each good old maxim,
     To march; a great convenience to our men,
       To match a common fury with her rage,
       Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,
     To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;
     To meditate upon their sins and self.
       To meet. However, 't is no time to chat
       To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,
     To mend his former morals, and get new,
     To mend the people 's an absurdity,
     To me;—of whom these morals are a sample.
     To me seems but a dubious kind of reed
     To me this kind of life is not so new;
     To-morrow 'd see us in some other den,
       To-morrow sees another race as gay
     To-morrow, what his Highness's physician
     (To my misfortune), never can I say
     To name a thing in nomenclature rather
     To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
     To no men are such cordial greetings given
     To Norman Abbey whirl'd the noble pair,—
     To novel power; and as she was the last,
       Too dull even for the dullest of excesses,
     To offer his young pinion as her fan.
     Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:
     Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction
       Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,
       Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise
       Too much of one sort would be soporific;—
     Too much their modest bard by this omission,
     To one small grass-grown patch (which must await
     Too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,
     Too often in its fury overcoming all
     Too old for youth,—too young, at thirty-five,
     To open all itself, without the power
     To ope this door, which they could really do,
       Too pure even for the purest human ties;
     Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.
     Too soon they are parents to themselves; for what
       Too subtle for the airiest human head;
     To others' share let 'female errors fall,'
     To our Theme.—The man who has stood on the Acropolis,
     Too wise to look through optics black or blue)—
       To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,
     To pain, the moment when you cease to please.
     To part with all till every hope was blighted),
     To pass, than those two cantos into families.
     To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,
       To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.
       To patriot sympathy a Briton's blushes,—
     To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish
     To pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;
       To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted
     To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;—
     To perish on the pavement: so I had
     To place him in the cave for present rest:
       To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
       To plays in five, and operas in three acts;
       To play upon the surface of humanity.
     To plunge with all your fears—but where? You know not,
     To poor Katinka: 'Spain 's an island near
     To prayer was heard no more!—and Juan wept,
       To proper placemen, every Russ credential;
     To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.
     To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.
     To prove its grand ingredient is ennui.
     To prove reluctant, and begg'd leave to crave
     To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.
     To prove the public debt is not consuming us—

     To the true portrait of one battle-field.
       To the unknown; a secret prepossession,
     To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,

       To think so: for half English as I am
           To think such breasts must suckle slaves
     To this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.
       To this long catechism of questions, ask'd
     To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation
       To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop
     To this we have added since, the love of money,
     To those related in my grand-dad's 'Narrative.'

            To turn church lands to lay,
     To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!
       To turn out both, or either, it may be.

     To where the last Caesarean fortress stood,
     To which embarrass'd people have recourse.
     To which the Levantines are very partial.
       To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,

       To whom it may be best to have recourse—
     To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.
       To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,
       To whom the opera is by no means new:
       To wield them in their terrible array.
       To wish him back a bachelor now and then.

     Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,
     Trampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,
       Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;

     Transform'd their lords to beasts (but that 's a fact).

       'T was a high place, the highest in the nation
     'T was all the same to him—'God save the king,'
     'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,
     'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,
     'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,
     'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,
     'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
     'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth
     'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,

     Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter
     Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,

     Weigh'd on his spirit, though by no means serious:
       Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,
       We know not this—the blood flows on too fast;
     We know, too, they very fond of war,
     We know what slavery is, and our disasters

     We learn from Horace, 'Homer sometimes sleeps;'

       Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,
     Were briskly fired and answer'd in due order.
     Were couches, toilets—and much more than this
     Were counted in them when they got afloat.
       Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;
     Were damnably mistaken; few are slow

     Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay
     Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.
     Were nothing but a moral inebriety.
     Were nothing but the natural atmosphere,

       Were something very glorious to behold.
     Were sonnets to herself, or 'bouts rimes.'
           Were still, at least, our countrymen.
     Were strung together like a row of pearls,
       Were such as could not in his breast be shut
       Were their reward for following Billy's banners:
       Were there a jot of sense among mankind;
     Were there not also Russians, English, many?
       Were there, with brows that did not much invite
     Were the sole echoes, save my steed's and mine,

     We surely may find something worth research:

     We whose minds comprehend all things? No more;
     We will have all things settled for you fairly.'
             We will not think of themes like these!
       We will omit the proofs, save one or two:
     We will revive our fortunes before long.
     We would against them make the flesh obey—
     What a delightful thing 's a turnpike road!
     What, after all, are all things—but a show?

     What! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?
     What can ye recognise?—a gilded cloud.

     What dilettanti do with vast parade)
     'What dost thou know of love or feeling?—Wretch!

     What may this midnight violence betide,
     What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
     What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,
       What Nature naturally most encourages)—
     What opposite discoveries we have seen!
     What pedigree the best would have to show?
       What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate

       When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull
     When a man's country 's going to the devil.
     When amatory poets sing their loves
     When, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,

       Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;

       When he who had the watch sung out and swore,
       When homicide and harlotry made great;
     When I call 'fading' martial immortality,
     When it grew rather late to set things right.
     When its quicksilver 's down at zero,—lo

       When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,
     When Juan spoke, too—it might be in sport—
     When Juan woke he found some good things ready,
     When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
     When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.
       When London had a grand illumination,
     When man in battle or in quarrel tilts,
     When matters must be carried by the touch
       When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!

     When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,
     When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'
     When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'
     When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
     When Rapp the Harmonist embargo'd marriage
     (When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.
       (When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),—
       When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;
     When she no more could read the pious print.
     When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,
     When shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,
     When some smart talker puts them to the test,
       When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;
     When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
     When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,
       When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude:
          When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,
     When the sale of new books is not so fleet
       When the stripp'd forest bows to the bleak air,
       When they behold the brave oppress'd with odds,
       When they built up unto his darling trees,—
     When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses
     When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;
     When they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,
     When they suspect that any one goes shares
     When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.
       When things beyond the common have occurr'd;—
     When this world shall be former, underground,
     When tired of play, he flirted without sin
     When two pure hearts are pour'd in one another,
     When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
     When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,
     When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,
     When we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,
     When we know what all are, we must bewail us,
       When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:
     When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!
     When, where, and how he chose for that repast.
     When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,
     When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?
       When wroth—while pleased, she was as fine a figure
     When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
     When your affairs come round, one way or t' other,
       Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:
     Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.
       Where all is virtue, and the winter season
       Where all sighs are deposited; and now
       Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?
     Where all the passions have, alas! but one vent.
       Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,
     Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss
       Where are the Dublin shouts—and London hisses?
     Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?
     Where are the Grenvilles? Turn'd as usual. Where
     Where are the Lady Carolines and Franceses?
     Where are those martyr'd saints the Five per Cents?
     Whereas, if all be true we hear of heaven
     Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,
     Whereas insisting in or out of season
       Whereas the other, after all its glare,
     Whereas this story 's actually true.
     Where blood was talk'd of as we would of water;
             Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
             Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
       Where different talents find their different marts;
       Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;
       Where'er collective wisdom can parade,
     Where every body has some separate aim,
     Where every kind of mischief 's daily brewing,
     Where fights not to the last some desperate heart
       'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'
       Where Geography finds no one to oblige her
     Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those
           Where grew the arts of war and peace,
     Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,
       Where he may fix himself like small 'Jack Horner,'
     Where his assets were waxing rather few,
     Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,
       Where I beheld what never was to be;
     Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings
       Where if men seek her not, and death be more
     Where I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'
     Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.
     Where is his will? (That 's not so soon unriddled.)
     Where is Lord This? And where my Lady That?
     Where is Napoleon the Grand? God knows.
             Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
     Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?
     'Where is the world?' cries Young, at eighty—'Where
     Where is the world of eight years past? 'T was there—
     Where juniper expresses its best juice,
     Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
       Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;
       Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.
       Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell:
       Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risk'd for Passion,
       Where London streets ferment in full activity;
       Where many a Gothic ornament remain'd,
     Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.
     Where mingled and yet separate appears
     Where Nabuchadonosor, king of men,
     Where none were dreamt of, unto love's affairs,
             Where nothing, save the waves and I,
       Where nought upon their passion could intrude,
       Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;
     Whereon immediately at his request
       Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender,
     Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss
     Where people always did as they were bid,
       Where perish'd in his fame the hero-boy,
     Where 's Brummel? Dish'd. Where 's Long Pole Wellesley? Diddled.
     Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille.
     Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds,
     Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed
       Where she was interested (as was said),
     Where ships have founder'd, as doth many a boat.
     Where still we flutter on for pence or praise.'
       Where 's Whitbread? Romilly? Where 's George the Third?
     Where the blue veins look'd shadowy, shrunk, and weak;
       Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:
       Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;—
       Where there were fewer houses and more ease;
       Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
       Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?
       Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
     Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;
       Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?
     Where three parts of his column yet remain.
       Where time through heroes and through beauties steers;
       Where transport and security entwine,
       Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,
       Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;
     'Where will you serve?'—'Where'er you please.'—'I know

     Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is);—

     Whose virtue lies in never being detected.

     Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.
     Who were accustom'd, as a sort of god,
       Who were immortal, could one tell their story?
       Who were not quite so fond of animal food;
       Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,
     Who were the very paragons of wives,
       Who were thus honour'd by the greatest chief
     Who, when we come to sum up the totality
       Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;
       Who wish'd they had a brother just like her,
       Who wish to take the tone of their society:
       Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:
     Who wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,
       Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen;
       Who would as 't were identify their dust
     Who would not sigh Ai ai Tan Kuuerheian
     Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,
       Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?),
     Why Adeline had this slight prejudice—
     Why call'd he 'Harmony' a state sans wedlock?
     Why call the miser miserable? as
       Why did they not then die?—they had lived too long
     Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life
       Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
     Why do their sketches fail them as inditers
     Why do they call me misanthrope? Because
       Why drink? Why read?—To make some hour less dreary.
     'Why Fame—but Fame you know 's sometimes a liar—
     'Why, general, if he hath no greater fault

       'Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean
     Why should not Life be equally content
     Why then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore
     Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise

     Why you should wear them.'—'What, though my soul loathes

       Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when
     Will go much farther than there 's need to mention.
     Will hardly leave you (as she 's not your wife)
     Will have a firm post-obit on posterity.
     Will hint allusions never meant. Ne'er doubt
     'Will it?' said Juan, sharply: 'Strike me dead,

       Will serve when there is plunder in a city;—
     Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,

     Will touch even heroes—and such was Suwarrow.
     Will turn upon 'political economy.'
     Will very often supersede the rest.
     Will wonder where such animals could sup!
     Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon—
     Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;
     With a carved lady on a monument.
     With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.
       Withal: it lies perhaps a little low,
     With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;
     With all it granted, and with all it grants.
     With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining
       With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,
       With all kinds of incorrigible samples
     With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon
       With all the added charm of form and feature,
       With all the ceremonies of his rank,
       With all the damsels in their long array,
     With all their chaste integrity of laws,
       With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,
       With all the lakers, in and out of place?
     With all the mystery by midnight caused;
     With all the pomp of power, it was a doubt
       With all the praises ever said or sung:
     With all the promise of as fine a face
     With all the trophies of triumphant song—
     With all things ladies want, save one or two,
       With all we can imagine of the skies,
     With a long memorandum of old stories.
       With amber mouths of greater price or less;
       With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:
       With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down
     With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,
     With any body in a ride or walk.
       With any kind of troublesome control;
     With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,
     With arguments according to their 'forte;'
       With a sirocco, for example, blowing,
     With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,
     With a soft besom will I sweep your halls,
     With aught which looks like despotism in view:
     With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,
     With a young benefactress,—so was she,
       With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond
     With bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;
     With buildings in the Oriental taste,
     With buttons form'd of pearls as large as peas,
     With Carlton, or with other houses? Try
     With case; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,
     With choral step and voice, the virgin throng.
       With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,
     With clownish heel, your popular circulation
       With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.
     With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
     With cypress branches hast thou Wreathed thy bowers,
     With,—'Damn your eyes! your money or your life!'
     With dandies dined; heard senators declaiming;
     With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,
     With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:
       With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
     Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
     With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,
       With emphasis, and also with good sense—
     With evening came the banquet and the wine;
     With every kindness short of ostentation,
     With eyes that look'd into the very soul
     With fair long locks, had also kept their station;
     With fascination in his very bow,
       With fashionable wines and conversation;
     With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung
       With flashing eyes and weapons: match'd with them,
       With floating draperies and with flying hair,
     With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill—
       With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,
     With furniture an exquisite apartment,
     With gentle force her white arms he unwound,
     With God and man's abhorrence for its gains.
       With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific
       With gore, like Nadir Shah, that costive sophy,
     With graceful action, science not a jot,
     With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,
     With Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face,
       With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic
       With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore
     With her sire's story makes the night less long;
     With her Son in her blessed arms, look'd round,
     With her the latter, though at times convenient,
     With her then, as in humble duty bound,
       With her was rare: and Adeline, who as yet
     With him it never was a word and blow,
     With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'
     With his Agrarian laws the high estate
       With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;
       With his dear 'Waggoners,' around his lakes.
       With his debut, which made a strong impression,
     With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.
     With his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,
       With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he
       With his superior, in a smile to trample
     With his two captives, by so queer a road,
     With his young wife—a time, and opportunity.
     With human blood that column was cemented,
       With human filth that column is defiled,
       Within a cable's length their vessels lay
     Within a cannon-shot length of the place
       Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind
     Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.
     Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,
       Within—et caetera. Shall I go on?—No!
       With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,
       Within her bosom (which was not too tough)
       Within him and to quell his corporal quaking,
     Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore
       With interest, and in turn was wont with rigour
     Within the extent of this fortification
       Within these latest thousand years or later.
       Within these walls to be broke in upon
     With Ismail's storm to soften it the more.
       With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,
       With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:
       With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see
       With joy to save, and dread of some mischance
     With Juan, left half-kill'd some stanzas back.
     With just enough of life to feel its pain,
       With just enough of talent and no more,
     With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.
       With, 'Ladies, it is time to go to rest.
       With little hope in such a rolling sea,
     With Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.
     With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,
       With love for many, and with fears for some;
       With many more by rank and fashion deck'd;
       With many of the military set,
       With many other warriors, as we said,
     With martial stoicism, nought seem'd to annoy
       With massy plate for armour, knives and forks
     With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.
     With memory excellent to get by rote,
       With mist, and every bird with him awakes,
       With modern history has but small connection:
       (With more beside if Juan had not stopp'd 'em).
     With more ease too she 'd tell a different story.
       With more of the monastic than has been
       With more than half the city at his back—
       With more than one profession, gains by all;
       With more than 'Oriental scrupulosity;'
     With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,
     With motives the most classical and pure,
     With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
     With much suspicion in his attitude;
     With much to excite, there 's little to exalt;
     With music; the most moderate shine as wits;
     With nature manners which are artificial,
     With Nature's genial genitors, so that
     With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,
       With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,
     With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;
     With nothing but the sky for a great coat.
       With nothing livid, still her lips were red;
     With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,
     With one or two small senses added, just
     With one star sparkling through it like an eye.
       With orders to the people to careen;
     With, or without thee, all things at a stand
     With other articles of ladies fair,
     With other Countesses of Blank—but rank;
       With other extras, which we need not mention,—
       With other people's eyes, or if her own
       With other relics of 'a former world,'
     Without a friend, what were humanity,
       Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show
     Without an awful wish to plunge within it.
       Without a Single scudo of salario;
     Without a small refreshment from the spheres.
     Without a stomach what were a good name?
       Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,
     Without a word of previous admonition,
     Without being much more horrible than Dante.
     Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;

     Your wars eternally, besides enjoying
       Your wise men don't know much of navigation;
       Your writers, who must either draw again
       You saw that she was sleeping by my side

     You see here was enough of occupation
     'You served at Widdin?'—'Yes.'—'You led the attack?'
     'You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded
       You should be civil in a modest way:
     You should but give few cartridges to such
     'You, sir,' said Baba, nodding to the one,
     You sneer, and I assure you this is true,
       You started back in horror to survey
       You surely are unwell, child! we must see,
     'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'
     Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;
     You 've heard of Raucocanti?—I 'm the man;
     You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:
     You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,
     You wake with headache, you shall see what then.
     You was not last year at the fair of Lugo,
     'You were the first i' the breach?'—'I was not slack
     'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
     'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'

     Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,
     I know that some would fain postpone this era,
     Of oriental plants, 'et cetera,'
     But then they have their claret and Madeira
     Or, like a flying Hour before Aurora,
     Even Nimrod's self might leave the plains of Dura,
     And for the effeminate villeggiatura—
     Battista; though (a name call'd shortly Tita),
     Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.
     Say I; by which quotation there is meant a
     (Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)
     'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa
     Observe; for that with me 's a 'sine qua.'
     Lord H. Amundeville and Lady A.
       Like that of hell. 'Lasciate ogni speranza
       Dreadful as Dante's rhima, or this stanza;
     While peaceful as if still an unwean'd lamb,
       Was made at length with those who dared to climb
     'Midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to climb,
     Who died in the then great attempt to climb
       He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,
     Touch'd his, nor that—nor any handsome limb
     There was a something in his turn of limb,
     And slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb
       At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,
     To find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,
     Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?
       He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
     The heap a moment more had made her tomb.
     Save change: I 've stood upon Achilles' tomb,
     Some hands unseen strew'd flowers upon his tomb:
       Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,
     They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb—
       No; but you have heard—I understand—be dumb!
       Surprise has this effect—to make one dumb,
           'T is but the living who are dumb.
     The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb—
       Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.
     Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
       Of these things, or by ridicule benumb
     Bob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob.
     As wife and friends did for the boils of job,—
     At last fall sick of imitating Job.
       Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job
     Beyond the rules of posting,—and the mob
       How much it costs us! yet each rising throb
       That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob
     What was 't to him to hear two women sob?
     An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb
     She cannot step as does an Arab barb,
     Nor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,
     No—none of these will do;—and then their garb!
     Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb—
     Upon such things would very near absorb
     Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!
     She saw he did not understand Romaic.
       With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific
       Too much of one sort would be soporific;—
       My cue for any time to be terrific:
     There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic
     Juan rejoin'd—'She was a Catholic,
       Old Erse or Irish, or it may be Punic
       Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic,
       With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic
     A mind diseased no remedy can physic
     And our Sophias are not so emphatic,
     Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic
     This subject quote; as it would be schismatic
     And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,
     But all was gentle and aristocratic
     And turn on things which no aristocratic
     A beauty at the season's close grown hectic,
     A rake turn'd methodistic, or Eclectic
     But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,
     But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,
     Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;
     So much, the bard had really been prophetic
     And 'Hayley's Triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,
     No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,
     I feel my heart become so sympathetic,
     Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,
     Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,
     Or turning marriage into arithmetic.
     I have not heard she was at all poetic,
     Like hail, to make a bloody diuretic.
     Seem'd to him half commercial, half pedantic,
     Inherent—what we mortals call romantic,
     But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,
     And Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,
     And always envy, though we deem it frantic.
       True knights, chaste dames, huge giants, kings despotic:
       This way of writing will appear exotic;
       Who sang when chivalry was more Quixotic,
     And really, if the sage sublime and Attic
     As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.
     And yet the British 'Damme' 's rather Attic:
     And still pursues the right;—to curb the bad
       All that the body perpetrates of bad;
       Account for every thing which may look bad
       My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,
     With something not much better, or as bad:
     And the long-boat's condition was but bad,
     Poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,
       She next decided he was only bad;
       Such appetite in one she had deem'd dead;
     Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
       Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,
             Ah! no;—the voices of the dead
     The very generations of the dead
     But by dim lights the portraits of the dead
     Haidee and Juan thought not of the dead—
     All nations have believed that from the dead
       His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)
     They won't lay out their money on the dead—
     Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:
     The languages, especially the dead,
     'Will it?' said Juan, sharply: 'Strike me dead,
       And air—earth—water—fire live—and we dead?
     And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.
       Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;
             A remnant of our Spartan dead!
     It were much better to be wed or dead,
       You hardly could perceive when he was dead.
     Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:
     The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,
     A second hiccup'd, 'Our old master 's dead,
     Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;
       No hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;
       Just for the present; and in his lull'd head
     Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,
       Would give up artlessly both heart and head
     To the live leg still clung the sever'd head.
     And what is strangest upon this strange head,
       The contrary; but then 't is in the head;
     'The Seraskier is knock'd upon the head,
     One on the arm, the other on the head.
     Let 's knock that old black fellow on the head,
       Passive obedience,—now raised up the head,
       On such occasions: not a single head
     Their sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,
     No harm unto a right legitimate head:
             And answer, 'Let one living head,
       Too subtle for the airiest human head;
     Replied, 'Your blood be then on your own head.'
       Was there chaste dame who had not in her head
       Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head,
     Hints from the independent heart or head
       But he had got Haidee into his head:
     I don't choose to say much upon this head,
     This by his heart, his rival by his head.
     The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,
     Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;
     (In whispers) to have turn'd his sovereign's head.
       Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;
     'Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,
     Seized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head
     And without turning his facetious head,
     And much was talk'd on all sides on that head:
     But they as soon shall circumcise my head!
     A whole one, and my heart flies to my head,—
       Began to lay about with steel and lead—
       Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,
       And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;
       Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:
       And there we go:—but where? five bits of lead,
     'Ashes to ashes'—why not lead to lead?
     Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead
     That suit in Chancery,—which some persons plead
       Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,
       Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead
       Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)
     No wonder then a purer soul should dread
     Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.
       Not to be rashly touch'd. But still more dread,
       Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.
     The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,
     I write the world, nor care if the world read,
     Polygamy may well be held in dread,
     With some, while others, who had more in dread
     I won't philosophise, and will be read.
     And that they have been so we all have read,
       He shut his door, and after having read
     A pretty name as one would wish to read,
       'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,
     For them and theirs with all who deign to read.
       In currents through the calmer water spread
     Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;
       Throbb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread
       The greater part of these were ready spread
     For all of us have either heard or read—
     Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?
     With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,
     A Russian officer, in martial tread
       And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,
     Each was the other's mirror, and but read
       Until their royal riddle 's fully read,
     In all these he was much and deeply read;
     He suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,
       As if they acted with the heart instead,
       And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had
       No sort of explanation could be had,
     The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had
     Indeed he could not. But what if he had?
     She thought to stab herself, but then she had
     At present weigh'd down by a doom which had
       Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had
     To perish on the pavement: so I had
     Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had
       The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had
     And stripp'd and look'd to—But why should I ad
       It being (not now, but only while a lad)
       Just at the proper time; and though a lad,
       It was not marvellous that a mere lad,
     But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,
     And one oar for a mast, which a young lad
     On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;
     She thought of killing Juan—but, poor lad!
     I don't much like describing people mad,
       All that the devil would do if run stark mad;
     His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!
       And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;
     So take him up; I 'll help you with the load.'
     With his two captives, by so queer a road,
     Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad
     A single cry would bring them all abroad:
     Outward dislike, which don't look well abroad;
       Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;
     That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,
       They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,
     The earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad
           Would break your shield, however broad.
     The fellow to lie groaning on the road:
     What a delightful thing 's a turnpike road!
       (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
       Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,
     For the first and last time; for, like a pad,
     For Eastern stays are little made to pad,
       Softest of melodies; and could be sad
     A kind of blunt compassion for the sad
     Of all tales 't is the saddest—and more sad,
     Of the true reason of his not being sad,
     But let me change this theme which grows too sad,
       All by which hell is peopled, or as sad
     Besides, I 've no more on this head to add;
       As human beings, or his ways are odd.
     I 've also seen some female friends ( 't is odd,
     Warn'd him against Greek worship, which looks odd
       Sometimes at six years old—though it seems odd,
     Required this conduct—which seem'd very odd.
     'She also had compassion and a bed.
       And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:
       Observed as strictly both at board and bed
     Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.
       With their rough faces throng'd about the bed
       'T is white, at least when they just rise from bed.
     But to sit up while others lie in bed,
     'T was midnight—Donna Julia was in bed,
     Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;
       Undrest, and rather slowly went to bed.
       Look'd more adapted to be put to bed,
     But wide awake she was, and round her bed,
       Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,
     The Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan's bed;
       To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
     Or was at least, unless 't is since defaced,
     Of candidates requesting to be placed,
       The hand from burning underneath them placed,
     Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;
     The fortress is call'd Ismail, and is placed
     And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
     Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,
     Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
       And promises to all—which last commenced
     She, for the future of her strength convinced.
       The hardness by long habitude produced,
     Cared most about; it need not now be pleaded—
       I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,
     If love paternal in his bosom pleaded
       And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.
       The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,
       Because the Turks could never be persuaded
     Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
       And such their creed was, till they were invaded,
       But as the Danube could not well be waded,
       A courier to the prince, and he succeeded
     Well, if I don't succeed, I have succeeded,
     He ask'd no further questions, and proceeded
       In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,
     Finding themselves so very much exceeded
     So that the few who met him hardly heeded,
     The only time when much success is needed:
     Because its own good pleasure hath decided.
       'Paulo Majora.' Juan, undecided
       Above the ice had like a skater glided:
       With some of those fair creatures who have prided
     As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)
     And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,
     A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;
     A lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,
     The lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,
     His way to—where he knew not—single handed;
     Lull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,
     Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,
     An 'ignis fatuus;' or as sailors stranded
     What all this meant: while Baba bow'd and bended
     Adeline and Don Juan rather blended
     But, ere the matter could be marr'd or mended,
     The conference or congress (for it ended
     His head, until the ceremony ended.
       Of his whole army, which so much abounded
     'T is odd, but true,—last war the News abounded
       Of those with which his Haidee's bosom bounded?
     Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,
       Shadows of glory! (lest I be confounded)
       About; a circumstance which has confounded
     It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded
       And then give way, subdued because surrounded;
     With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded
     'You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded
       When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!
       O, ye less grand long lists of kill'd and wounded!
     Is twice as strong as that where you were wounded.
     More with these dinners than the kill'd or wounded;—
       Be that the greater part were kill'd or wounded,
       Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;
       A thing which victory by no means boded
       His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
       Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
       Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,—
     And as for love—O love!—We will proceed.
       By all means let the gentleman proceed;
     I say, in my slight way I may proceed
       That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed;
     Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,
     To taste of heaven—If this be true, indeed
     He 's wrong—unless man were a pig, indeed,
       It is a very serious thing indeed:
       She thought with some simplicity indeed;
       Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;
       I would not you for nothing should be fee'd—
       As he before had done. He did not heed
       Or wish to make a rival's bosom bleed:
     Juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed
       In giving to his brethren their full meed
       Virtues of which both you and I have need;—
       And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,
       And simple in the world, and doth not need
       The fame you envy and the skill you need.
       There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need—
     On which Jack and his train set off at speed,
       And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,
     There 's music in the sighing of a reed;
       But Strongbow's wit was of more polish'd breed:
       Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:
     My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed
     Those vegetables of the Catholic creed
     Some Christians have a comfortable creed.
     In the faith of their procreative creed,
     To me seems but a dubious kind of reed
     Unless he 's drunk, and then no doubt he 's freed
     Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.
       And when she saw him stumbling like a steed
       As beautiful and bounding as a steed,
       Contend not with you on the winged' steed,
       Nimrods, whose canvass scarce contain'd the steed;
       Longbow from Ireland, Strongbow from the Tweed,
       Of office, or the house of office, fed
       With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;
       Who watch'd him like a mother, would have fed
       Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed
     (Widows of forty were these birds long caged)
     Some voices of the buxom middle-aged
     But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,
       Poor creatures! their good looks were sadly changed.
       And age, and sex, were in the market ranged;
       From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;
     And in their native beauty stood avenged:
     For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,
     Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged
       And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?
       Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed
     Has madness seized you? would that I had died
     And if in the mean time her husband died,
       Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,
     A kerchief, crying, 'Give Sal that!'—and died.
     In one voluptuous blaze,—and then he died,
     Save death or Doctors' Commons—so he died.
     Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.
     But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,
     The creature was his father's dog that died,
     For David lived, but Juan nearly died.
     His five brave boys no less the foe defied;
     And not our own. I am too qualified
       Unless her cause by right be sanctified.
     Deeming the sage would be much mortified,
       And kings and consorts oft are mystified,
       Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied
     But he would not be taken, and replied
     When Juan answer'd—'Spanish!' he replied,
       Of this their mutual feeling, she replied—
     'The Georgian and her paramour,' replied
     To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,
     'May it please your excellency,' thus replied
     Baba, with some embarrassment, replied
       And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied
       The phrase is Shakspeare's, and not misapplied:
     Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
     A great resource to all, and ne'er denied
     With some remorse received (though first denied)
     The animals aforesaid occupied
     And said that she was sorry she had cried.
     Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,
       And looking coldly in her face, he cried,
     'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,
       Was not asleep—'Yes, search and search,' she cried,
       Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried
     Till, in approaching, were at length descried
     With prophets, houris, angels, saints, descried
       Is not at once too palpably descried.
     For morals, marriage; and this question carried,
     And then he had good looks;—that point was carried
     How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!
     To say leads oft to crim. con. with the married—
     So much, he always doubted I was married—
     She seriously advised him to get married.
     Since with digressions we too long have tarried.
     More easily than answer'd,—that he had tried
       And if this violent remedy be tried—
     But that 's her way with all men, till they 're tried;
       Because she said her temper had been tried
     The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.
     His breath,—he from his swelling throat untied
     His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied
       'Twere difficult to say, but Juan looked
       Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked
       Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,
       Her Grace too had a sort of air rebuked,
     In vain he kick'd, and swore, and writhed, and bled,
       The surgeon had his instruments, and bled
       Which for the last, though not the first, time bled:
     And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,
     Not so Haidee: she sadly toss'd and tumbled,
     Dream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,
             Must we but blush?—Our fathers bled.
     The sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.
     At which the whole court was extremely troubled,
     Where 's Brummel? Dish'd. Where 's Long Pole Wellesley? Diddled.
     Full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,
     Gone down, it seems, to Scotland to be fiddled
     Where is his will? (That 's not so soon unriddled.)
     His pockets first and then his body riddled.
       For having had him to her palace led,
     Which, for what I know, may of yore have led
     They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;
     Until the memory of an age is fled,
       Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,—
     The ladies with more moderation mingled
     The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;
     And rushing in disorderly, though led,
     His only shrine of feelings undefiled.
       With human filth that column is defiled,
     O! ye who build up monuments, defiled
     Little he said, and now and then he smiled,
     But I am not so sure I should have smiled
     Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled—
     Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled
       Although their haram education led
     The next are 'only children', as they are styled,
     Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,
     Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
     His mother was a learned lady, famed
     She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
     I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
       His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed
       That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed
       The Russian officer for life was lamed,
     In every Christian language ever named,
       (Like lucus from no light); through prospects named
       Of double nature, and thus doubly named—
       Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed
       Whene'er their triumph pales, or star is tamed:—
     But Adeline, who probably presumed
       Half virtues and whole vices being combined;
     Might shock a connoisseur; but when combined,
     Who on the very loftiest kings have dined,—
     In motion; but she here too much refined—
     For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,
     Wounded and fetter'd, 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,'
       States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,
       Under a canopy, and there reclined
     The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
       Or love.—I won't say more about 'entwined'
     But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,
       And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,
       To heaving back the portal folds: it scared
     He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,
        Is like a duckling by Dame Partlett reared
     Fill'd as with lightning—for his spirit shared
     But ere they came to this, they that day shared
     But still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,
       And looking like two incubi, they glared
     At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,
       At least it rhymes to 'love;' but I 'm prepared
       Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
       Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,
        Are tutors, guardians, and so forth, compared
     Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared;
       With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;
     But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred
     Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,
       Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,
       All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred
     And about twice two thousand people bred
       Like most in the belief in which they 're bred,
     His holy temples in the lands which bred
       To like too readily, or too high bred
     Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
       Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.
       It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
     Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;
       The ladies,—who by no means had been bred
     Both wits—one born so, and the other bred—
     And bright as any meteor ever bred
       Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,
     From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red—
     I think to canter gently through a hundred.
       And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.
     Besides, he had not seen of several hundred
     All bad propensities in fifteen hundred
     Firstly, he said, 'he never interfered
       With nothing livid, still her lips were red;
       Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red
     A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.
     The learned tutors whom for him she hired,
       The same things cannot always be admired,
       Of charms that should or should not be admired.
     From his translation; but had none admired,
       A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;
       The supper too discuss'd, the dames admired,
       The rosy flood of twilight's sky admired;—
       The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.
     Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?
       The song was silent, and the dance expired:
       That both are tied till one shall have expired.
       And every sound of revelry expired;
     Though full of all things which could be desired,
     If matters had been managed as desired,
     But that which Donna Inez most desired,
       They sometimes also get a little tired
       The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;
     Of what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,
     At last they reach'd a quarter most retired,
       Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,
       At least he kept his vanity retired.
       For then the gentlemen were rather tired)
     And here she summon'd Baba, and required
       Then there was small-talk ready when required;
     Of articles which nobody required;
     Much into all his studies she inquired,
     Form'd of two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.
       That worse than worst of foes, the once adored
     She loved, and was beloved—she adored,
     Much I respect, and much I have adored,
     Of sentiment; and he she most adored
     And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,
     The passage you so often have explored—
     And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,
     The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;
     But by degrees their senses were restored,
     Or the Red Sea—but the sea is not red.
     And if they had, they could not have secured
     Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
     By length I mean duration; theirs endured
     They had not spoken; but they felt allured,
     To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
     But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,
     His peace was making, but before he ventured
     There was no mighty reason to be pleased;
       And every new creation hath decreased
     Had raised an interest in her, which increased.
       Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;
       By which their power of mischief is increased,
       By which the more a haram is increased,
       Whose victories had recently increased
       By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased
     But to resume. The languid Juan raised
     And ask'd why such a structure had been raised:
     Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,
     And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised
       He probably would have philosophised:
     They little knew, or might have sympathised,
     By matter, and so much materialised,
       Felt restless, and perplex'd, and compromised:
     A prologue which but slightly harmonised
       The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,
       Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;
       Not calculating how much they condensed;
       He was all things to all men, and dispensed
     Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
     The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,
       And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;
     His eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,
     The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
     And whether it ought not to be disclosed,
       Until a royal smile at length disclosed
     Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed
     Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed
     A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed
     And wish'd it death in which he had reposed;
     But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed
       The letter open with an air which posed
       forgetting quite the woman (which composed
     A lonely pure affection unopposed:
     He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,
       Whate'er she did not see, if she supposed
     Suppose,—but you already have supposed,
     And here Juanna kindly interposed,
     The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:
     Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed
     She did not find herself the least disposed
     Poets and private tutors are exposed,
     Walk'd o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed
       Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;
     With all the mystery by midnight caused;
     Then slacken'd it, which is the march most caused
     She stopp'd, and raised her head to speak—but paused,
     And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
       The mercy he had granted oft abused,
     And next his savage virtue he accused,
     And first he wonder'd why he had refused;
     The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
     Not one, except the attorney, was amused;
       To bode him no great good, he deprecated
     And prophecy—except it should be dated
       At whatsoever risk of being defeated.
       Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,
       And he arose, advanced. The shade retreated,
     But not the less for this to be depreciated:
     And there is much which could not be appreciated
     There 's also nightly, to the uninitiated,
     In any manner by the uninitiated.
     The show of virtue even in the vitiated—
       I 'd rather not say what might be related
       He could not help the thing which he related:
     Some years before the incidents related.
     About this time, as might have been anticipated,
     They are young, but know not youth—it is anticipated;
     On our fresh feelings, but—as being participated
     Both senates see their nightly votes participated
     Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;
     Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;
       Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated
     And divers smoked superb pipes decorated
       And tell them—But you won't, and I have prated
       On life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,
       Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;
     Of others with her own opinions, stated—
       Besides there might be falsehood in what 's stated:
       'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,
     That leads to lassitude, the most infected
     And on our sofas makes us lie dejected,
     It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected
     To find how very badly she selected.
       Was Juan; whom she seem'd to have selected
       A guardian green in years, a ward connected
     Nor use those palisades by dames erected,
     His morns he pass'd in business—which, dissected,
     Whose virtue lies in never being detected.
       He naturally loved what he protected:
     Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.
     And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,
     In the great world,—which, being interpreted,
     Till some confounded escapade has blighted
     To part with all till every hope was blighted),
     At the full board, and sit alike delighted
     In fact much more astonish'd than delighted,
     The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
     And now 't was done—on the lone shore were plighted
     Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:
     All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,
     And then with violence the old ship righted.
     Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;
       Beyond the charmers we have already cited;
       Who must be courteous to the accredited
     By their own feelings hallow'd and united,
     But once a week or fortnight, uninvited
     To find so much good company invited.
     At seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted
       After a decent time must be gallanted;
       But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted
     At eighteen, though below her feet still panted
       Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
       Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,
     To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted
       And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
     He tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,
       Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;
       Denying several little things he wanted:
     It was not the physician that he wanted.
       Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;
     To ask the reverend person what he wanted.
     Thus is the trophy used, and thus lamented
     With human blood that column was cemented,
     By rendering desperate those who had else repented.
     A little still she strove, and much repented
     And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'—consented.
     As if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented
     But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,
     His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.
     Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted
       With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,
     At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,
       To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted
       Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted
       A favourite horse fallen lame just as he 's mounted,
     Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
     She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
     Receive as gospel, and which grow more rooted,
     All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
     But one thing 's odd, which here must be inserted,
     The little Turk refused to be converted.
     Much to his youth, and much to his reported
     Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,
     Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,—
     As e'er was locust on the land it blasted.
     The soil of the green province he had wasted,
     I can't help thinking puberty assisted.
     Others in monosyllable talk chatted,
     Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted
       Against her being mention'd as well fitted,
     Yet, if examined, it might be admitted
       Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,
     Like a backgammon board the place was dotted
     It chanced amongst the other people lotted,
     Though rather more irregularly spotted:
     As all truths must, the more they are disputed:
     Who could not get the place for which he sued.
       So that some disappointment there ensued
     If in the circumstances which ensued
     As soon as 'Crowner's quest' allow'd, pursued
     He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
       While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,
       Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved
     And 'Europe's Liberator'—still enslaved.
       His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved
       Through his means and the church's might be paved.
       Whether hell's pavement—if it be so paved—
       He loved the infant orphan he had saved,
       Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,
     Call'd 'Saviour of the Nations'—not yet saved,
     For such sights, though the tale is half believed,
       She hoped he would improve—perhaps believed:
       At which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved,
       He was to travel; and though Inez grieved
       According to direction, then received
       And looking, as he always look'd, perceived
     The friar of late has not been oft perceived.
     By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,
     Of any wicked woman, who contrived
     The major part of them had long been wived,
       Of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,'
       Neither can show quite how they would be loved.
     For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,
       Juan, who for an instant had been moved
     So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,
       The sentimental boasts to be unmoved;
       Unless like wise Tiresias we had proved
     All it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,
       Bright with the very weakness he reproved;
       Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,
       Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:
     Most wise men, with one moderate woman wed,
       A thing which happens rarely: this he owed
       Is all the rest about her! Whether wed
     'T is pity learned virgins ever wed
     To lengthen fetters by another fixed
     And offer poison long already mixed.
     Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:
     Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,
     From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,
     A sight on which he had not lately gazed,
     And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,
     He still was in the boat and had but dozed,
     As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,
     Unless with people who too much have quaff'd,
     'Why?—Why?—Besides, Fred really was attach'd;
     Upon the tree which Eve so fondly search'd.
     Offence, we know not; probably it perch'd
     But the old marchioness some plan had hatch'd,
     The time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd
     Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)
     And looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,
     Till wanted; therefore Juan only sigh'd.
     And chafed at poor Dudu, who only sigh'd,
     A sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,
     Though the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd
       And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd
       The river from the lake, all bluely dash'd
       Though much in temper; but they never clash'd:
     The spray into their faces as they splash'd.
       The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;
       Which, providentially for him, was wash'd
       Or like the Rhone by Leman's waters wash'd,
       He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd
     To make him prisoner, was also dish'd:
       Like Peter the Apostle,—and he fish'd
     To hold some sinecures he wish'd abolish'd,
     But that with them all law would be demolish'd.
     His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd
     That drinks and still is dry. At last they perish'd—
     The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourish'd,
       And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;
     An English naval officer, who wish'd
     Of billows; but at intervals there gush'd,
     Of echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,
     And first one universal shriek there rush'd,
       No permanent foundation can be laid;
       And also, as may be presumed, she laid
     At length, in an imperial way, she laid
     I pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:
       Which colder hearts endure till they are laid
     And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;
       The tables, most of ebony inlaid
       As many covers, duly, daily, laid.
     And therefore side by side were gently laid,
       I mourn, but for the past;—I loved a maid:'-
     One 's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid,
     But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
     Although he was not old, nor even a maid;—
     He look'd in almost all respects a maid,
     Young Juan slept all dreamless:—but the maid,
             But gazing on each glowing maid,
     I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,
     A trace unworthy either wife or maid;—
       In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;—
       Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
     Protects his dust, but reverence here is paid
     With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:
     Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,
     Except his majesty, who, with her aid,
     He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,
     Something of which its masters are afraid,
       But was used sparingly,—some were afraid,
     But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,
     His berth a little damp, and him afraid.
     'T is surely Juan now—No! I 'm afraid
     Occurr'd what often happens, I 'm afraid,
     Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
     Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:
     But here Katinka interfered, and said,
     Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,
     The arts, at least all such as could be said
     He raised his whistle, as the word he said,
       Nature had written 'gentleman.' He said
     And being told it was 'God's house,' she said
     He slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said
       And proved it—'t was no matter what he said:
       And here exactly follows what he said:—
     I shall not say exactly what he said,
     'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:
       'T is not my present lot, as I have said,
     Still there was something wanting, as I 've said—
       With many other warriors, as we said,
     Turning round to the rest, he smiling said.
     And then he call'd his brethren to his aid,
     Gulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)
     Drains its first draught of lips:—but, as I said,
     'I will, my dear Philosophy!' I said,
     And march away—'t were easier done than said.'
     And Juan was received, as hath been said,
       No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;
       'Twas night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.
     Of these few could say more than has been said;
     I merely mean to say what Johnson said,
     So as I gazed on him, I thought or said—
       Mind like the wind: whatever she has said
       Of counsellors,' as Solomon has said,
     Young, handsome, and accomplish'd, who was said
       Where she was interested (as was said),
     Even with his life—for (but they lie) 't is said
     Of our artillery and his own: 't is said
          By the marriage-bed of their lords, 't is said,
     It costs three francs for every mass that 's said.
     With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
     All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,
     By this old black enchanter's unsought aid.'
       A single tear upon his eyelash staid
       Brief, but delightful—such as had not staid
     But soon Philosophy came to my aid,
     Where people always did as they were bid,
       Turn'd to the merchant, and begun to bid
     He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.
     He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
     In their own way by all the things that she did.
     As usual—the same reason which she late did.
     Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.
     If you think 't was philosophy that this did,
     In darkness—I can only hope they did.
       They haggled, wrangled, swore, too—so they did!
     That all the Apostles would have done as they did.
     Guessing at what shall happily be hid,
     But whether they escaped or no, lies hid
       To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
       Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;
     Or careless; but the effort was not valid
     To hinder him from growing still more pallid.
       Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
     As the real purpose of a pyramid.
       Cheops erected the first pyramid
     In the mean time, cross-legg'd, with great sang-froid,
       Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void
     And hence high life is oft a dreary void,
     Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid
     If she had not mistaken him for Cupid.
     (But this last simile is trite and stupid).
     Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),
     And then he talk'd with him about Madrid,
     Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid
     And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,
     And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,
       But ended in his being found out and sack'd,
       But with a moral to each error tack'd,
     But now the town is going to be attack'd;
       In their vocation) had not been attack'd
       And with all passions in their turn attack'd;
     From the manure of human clay, though deck'd
       With many more by rank and fashion deck'd;
     A wavering spirit may be easier wreck'd,
       'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:
     Excepting only when the former 's pick'd
     Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:
     Upon the head, before their guns were cock'd.
     Putting the very bravest, who were knock'd
       The female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd
       By eunuchs flank'd; while at their head there stalk'd
       The galleries from room to room they walk'd,
       With which Aurora on those baubles look'd,
       For there are few things by mankind less brook'd,
       Which hesitation more betray'd than mask'd;
       To this long catechism of questions, ask'd
       His best to obey in what he had been task'd;
     Also the younger men too: for a springald
     On her sire's arm, which until now scarce held
       No less a friend to government—he held,
     New batteries were erected, and was held

       And General Fireface, famous in the field,
     And rally back his Romans to the field.
     Sunk, and the crimson cross glared o'er the field,
     To the true portrait of one battle-field.
     He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,
     In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,
     Such were his trophies—not of spear and shield,
     His stubborn valour was no future shield.
     Yet I must own,—although in this I yield
     The town was taken—whether he might yield
     Past, present, and to come;—but all may yield
       He added modestly, when rebels rail'd),
     That stranger to most councils, here prevail'd,
       And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:
     Two villainous Cossacques pursued the child
     An active hermit, even in age the child
     She had so much, or little, of the child.
     Crime came not near him—she is not the child
     At six, I said, he was a charming child,
       The Virgin Mother of the God-born Child,
     The other father had a weaklier child,
     But Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child
     Over the innocence of that sweet child,
     Pronounces that an 'only' 's a spoilt child.
     Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
     But the boy bore up long, and with a mild
       The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild—
     That where their education, harsh or mild,
     The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;
     Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil'd
       Spared by some chance when all beside was spoil'd;
     Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoil'd.
       To show his loathing of the spot he soil'd:
     His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,
     Who, after leaving Hindostan a wild,
     Although in infancy a little wild,
       Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild
     Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,
     Of Nature, or the man of Ross run wild.
       This may be superstition, weak or wild,
     The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild
       What could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:
     Alas! worlds fall—and woman, since she fell'd
     Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.
     Poor thing of usages! coerced, compell'd,
       'Twixt place and patriotism—albeit compell'd,
     And every difficulty being dispell'd,
       Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he kill'd.
       In his grave office so completely skill'd,
       Of all our pumps:—a wreck complete she roll'd,
     Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd
       A like gold bar above her instep roll'd
       All this, the most were patient, and some bold,
     This spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold,
     Against all noble maladies he 's bold,
       Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold
     But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,
       In this our party; polish'd, smooth, and cold,
     And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,
     Now this at all events must render cold
       Quite full, right dull, guests hot, and dishes cold,
     How to encounter with this martial scold,
     And never once he has had cause to scold,
     When, ere the ink be dry, the sound grows cold.
     Serene and noble,—conjugal, but cold.
     But I grow sad—and let a tale grow cold,
     Generals, some all in armour, of the old
       The new world would be nothing to the old,
     I care not for new pleasures, as the old
     'The prima donna, though a little old,
       Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold
     Others in wigs of Marlborough's martial fold,
     His turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,
       Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,
     As do the subtle snakes described of old.
       There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;
       Of such a spirit in these halls of old,
     The difference is, that in the days of old
     Pinn'd like a flock, and fleeced too in their fold,
     Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,
       Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,
       Lockless—so pliable from the pure gold
       I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,
     The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,
     Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,
     Lordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:
       Toss'd overboard unsaleable (being old);
     And is not much improved by growing old.'
     'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'—'Hold!'
       How differently the world would men behold!
     The sights he was accustom'd to behold,
     With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;
     Their union was a model to behold,
       But fair as then, or fairer to behold.
       Were something very glorious to behold.
       Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold
     The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,
     The lawyer and the critic but behold
       More tender, as we every day behold,
       Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,
       Reserved for future ransom—in the hold
       Method 's more sure at moments to take hold
     The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,
     But as it was, his Highness had to hold
     'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold
     'T is pity that it takes no farther hold
       A gale, and in the fore and after hold
       And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,
     Love 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold
     Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.
       'T was a great banquet, such as Albion old
     The dangerous life in which he had grown old,
     That I have chosen a confessor so old
       Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold
       Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,
       Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;
     'What, sir!' said Juan, 'shall it e'er be told
     And the perplexity could not be told
       Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;
     Because the present tale has oft been told,
     And nought remains unseen, but much untold,
     A paragraph in every paper told
       And all which must be borne, and never told;
     Which must not be pathetically told.
     While common men grow ignorantly old,
     Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl'd;
     About the prettiest ankle in the world.
     Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!
       With other relics of 'a former world,'
       Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp'd, and curl'd,
     Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd
       Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd

     He also stuff'd his money where he could
     Of its disease; he did the best he could
     Don Juan, having done the best he could
     I know not who may conquer: if I could
       Space to dispute what no one ever could
       Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could
     Napoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should
     And I will war, at least in words (and—should
     Esteeming it a little hard he should
       'T was not to be expected that he should,

       To the old text, still better:—lest it should
       And they revealed, alas, that ere they should,
     Even of the highest for a female mould,
       Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,
       The limb which it adorn'd its only mould;
     Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,
     In which a Princess with great pleasure would
     And this same state we won't describe: we would
     Strain'd on the spot where first the figure gleam'd;
       And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)
       As the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd
       Of whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,
       Suck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;
       To be her happiness, and whom she deem'd
       And everybody but his mother deem'd
       A drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd
       Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd
       That bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd
     He stood—how long he knew not, but it seem'd
     And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.
       With 'To be let' upon their doors proclaim'd;
       And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:
     Or separate maintenance, in case 't was doom'd—
     That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,
     Below her breast was fasten'd with a band
     In one point only were you settled—and
       Of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and
     The courtiers stared, the ladies whisper'd, and
       He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand
     Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand.
     Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,
     To see his orders done, too, out of hand—
       Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,
     Are apt to carry things with a high hand,
     But Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,
       And tremulously gentle her small hand
     And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,
       Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,
       Because the clergy take the thing in hand;
     I quite forget which of them was in hand
       They little think what mischief is in hand;
     Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,
     Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.
       Especially with politics on hand;
     Fishery and farm, both into his own hand.
       And they continued battling hand to hand,
     The very servants puzzling how to hand
       And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand
     Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;
       Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:
     Even to the delicacy of their hand
       Some down, and weighing others in their hand,
       It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:
     Her father's face—but never stopp'd his hand.
     He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand
     The ruby glass that shakes within his hand
     With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,
     Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand
     And 'entremets' to piddle with at hand,
       A moral country? But I hold my hand—
     The squires familiarly formal, and
       A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
     It may seem strange to find his manners bland;
       In liquid lines mellifluously bland,
     On her canals, where God takes sea and land,
     I have seen the funds at war with house and land—
       Against the creed and morals of the land,
       Alfonso's days had not been in the land
       Of what befell our hero in the land,
     As one who was a lady in the land.
       And, like a wither'd lily, on the land
     As beautiful as her own native land,
     Now, if this holds good in a Christian land,
       As flourishing in every Christian land,
       For night was dosing ere they came to land.
     And rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,
     Around, as princess of her father's land,
     Of early life; but this is a new land,
     Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.
       Flashes into the heart:—All sunny land
     Are, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!
       All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand
     There was a something which bespoke command,
     Of half voluptuousness and half command.
     Now in a person used to much command—
     Even then their love they could not all command,
       The general who held him in command;
       For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;
     That great enchanter, at whose rod's command
       His temper not being under great command,
     Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command
     Who took by turns that difficult command
     Fretted with gold or silver:—by command,
     All this she told with some confusion and
     But for the present, gentle reader! and
     Juanna should be taken from her, and
     If he speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and
     Seeing how Art can make her work more grand
       To end or to begin with; the next grand
     Glided along the smooth and harden'd sand,
       And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand
       Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;
     I have seen the people ridden o'er like sand
     I said they were alike, their features and
       And pulling out reluctant purses, and
     I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and
     There was no want of lofty mirrors, and
     His suite consisted of three servants and
     Leaves a sad sediment of Time's worst sand.
       As much of German as of Sanscrit, and
     And for their rights connubial make a stand,
       Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,
     Antonia's patience now was at a stand—
     With, or without thee, all things at a stand
     And now to see them, thus divided, stand
       (And she had some not easy to withstand)
     Who several languages did understand,
     We meet again, if we should understand
       I don't pretend that I quite understand
       But 't is as well at once to understand,
       As Ovid's verse may give to understand;
     Which foreigners can never understand.
     With things I can't withstand or understand,
     Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;
     From their high places by the sideboard's stand—
     At length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,
       'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
     And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and
       About his ears, and nathless would not bend:
       Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend
     Might probably attain both in the end,
       Or make a Werter of him in the end.
     Of which the surest sign is in the end:
       In poesy, unless perhaps the end;
       For malice still imputes some private end,
       Dear is the helpless creature we defend
     I ask but this of mine, to—not defend.
       Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend
       But not a word could Juan comprehend,
       This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;
       Her speech out to her protege and friend,
       Particularly with a tiresome friend:
       For like an aged aunt, or tiresome friend,
       Some heir to a large property, some friend
       With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
       Both in the case of lover and of friend,
     While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,
       Was not confined to feeling for her friend,
     How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!
             Was freedom's best and bravest friend;
     Explicitly our several posts, my friend
       Peruse! 'T is always with a moral end
       Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend
       A maddening spirit which would strive to blend
             O! that the present hour would lend
       Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend
     Which fortune plainly seem'd to recommend;
       A kind of triumph I 'll not recommend,
       Unless a marriage was applied to mend
       Unless her habits should begin to mend:
       Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,
       My Muse by exhortation means to mend
     When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.
       A thousand times of him had made an end;
       Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
       By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end
       On which the passion's self seems to depend:
       Than wear a heart a woman loves to rend.
       Selfish in its beginning as its end,
       To bring what was a jest to a serious end:
       The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,
     Her eye dilated and her colour heighten'd.
       Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end
     For she seem'd agitated, flush'd, and frighten'd,
     And self would know what duty to attend.'
     And thus heroically stood resign'd,
     More in the eyelids than the eyes, resign'd
       A lady; Baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd
     Of every monarch, till they are consign'd
     An order from her majesty consign'd
     (I have had of both, some not to be disdain'd),
       Of nicety, where a fact is to be gain'd),—
     I wish they 'd state how many they have gain'd.
     By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd
          A monk remain'd, unchased, unchain'd,
     With Raucocanti lucklessly was chain'd
       Also the muffin whereof he complain'd,
     And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,
     Of poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,
       Where many a Gothic ornament remain'd,
     Found only on the stage, and each more pain'd
       Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain'd
     Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain'd,
       At which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;
     And others still their appetites constrain'd,
     The good old gentleman had been detain'd
       Of these is not exactly ascertain'd
     All except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,
     Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,
       Good to the soul which we no more can bind;
     But here he was!—where each tie that can bind
           Such chains as his were sure to bind.
       Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,
       As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
       He stumbled on, to try if he could find
     But Glory's glory; and if you would find
       Also thereon,—but that 's not much; we find
       Blood is not water; and where shall we find
       And took his kingdom from him: You will find,
       And you will be perhaps surprised to find
       Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find.
       For neither of them could I ever find,
     In Britain—which of course true patriots find
     And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'
       As all have found on trial, or may find,
       And, what was stranger, never look'd behind;
       But to proceed—for there is more behind:
     A hospital, a church,—and leave behind
       In such a sort as cannot leave behind
     Because the monks preferr'd a hill behind,
       And botching, patching, leaving still behind
     The world is all before me—or behind;
       By death, when we are left, alas! behind,
       Than on the name a person leaves behind:
       Of the two principles, but leaves behind
     Or like a billow left by storms behind,
       But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,
       Upon reflection, knowing that behind
     Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
       And then my stoicism leaves nought behind
       Because it left encouragement behind:
       Quite common in those countries, are a kind
     Of those in office: all the world look'd kind
       Child to the care of guardians good and kind;
           Another despot of the kind!
       (If but for comfort) that all things are kind:
       Her beauty of that overpowering kind,
       And that was of a fascinating kind.
       They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,
     It was a moment of that awful kind—
     A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind
     Have left undone the greatest—and mankind.
       Suspended may illuminate mankind,
     Perhaps he fain would liberate mankind
       Following the 'ignes fatui' of mankind.
       To the good sense and senses of mankind,
       Upon the moral lessons of mankind:
     But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,
     His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,—
       Were there a jot of sense among mankind;
       Cobbling at manacles for all mankind,
     False friend, who held out freedom to mankind,
       O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!
       Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,
       Bills, beasts, and men, and—no! not womankind!
     To the great pleasure of our friends, mankind,
     Done anything exceedingly unkind,—
     Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,
     He was a mortal of the careless kind,
       To some she show'd attention of that kind
     Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.
     For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:
       Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;
       Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
     Or as a little dog will lead the blind,
       The present century was growing blind
     If, after all, there should be some so blind
       Over the hills, a fire enough to blind
       But the old way is best for the purblind:
     Eutropius of its many masters, blind
       Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,
       Of forms and features; it would strike you blind
       Follies trick'd out so brightly that they blind:—
       To all, except one image, madly blind;
     Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
       As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.
     Compassion breathes along the savage mind.
       The mystical usurper of the mind—
     Yet left a grand impression on the mind,
       Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind
       A sort of ignis fatuus to the mind,
     And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
     If we may judge of matter by the mind,
     'T is thus the spirit of a single mind
       The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,
     The goodliest soil of body and of mind.
     Following the bent of body or of mind)
       A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,
     Led by some tortuosity of mind,
     And though 't was not much to a naval mind,
     And he whose very body was all mind,
     And quite enough for me to keep in mind;—
     Which youth would not act ill to keep in mind),
     You did great things; but not being great in mind,
       I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,
       So by the poesy of his own mind
     I have seen such—but must not call to mind.
       And I can give my whole soul up to mind;
     Could altogether call the past to mind;
       Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.
       I shall offend all parties: never mind!
       Is sometimes truculent—but never mind:
       Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind
       Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,
     Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,
       A lady altogether to his mind.
     Juan was moved; he had made up his mind
     Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)
       But still I think I can collect my mind;
     And now would chain them, to the very mind:—
     Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, join'd
       At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:
       As roll the waves before the settled wind;
       Than if I sought to sail before the wind.
     Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;
     Without the animation of the wind;
     To shelter their devotion from the wind.
       Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind
     'T was not without some reason, for the wind
     What that is—ask the pig who sees the wind!
       Boscan, or Garcilasso;—by the wind
       Of idle apprehensions, which like wind
     As roll the waters to the breathing wind,
       'T is something, nothing, words, illusion, wind—
     The rugged tree unto the summer wind,
     Unless compell'd by fate, or wave, or wind,
     A mixture of sensations might be scann'd,
     A fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd
       Until the sum was accurately scann'd,
       To—say my prayers—but never was there plann'd
     Work'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd,
       But the fact is that I have nothing plann'd,
     I 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd
       To say her daughter's feelings are trepann'd;
       For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:
       But mix'd with pity, pure as e'er was penn'd:
       And founded Doctors' Commons:—I have conn'd
     Yet 't is 'so nominated in the bond,'
       Is always so to women; one sole bond
     And since that time there has not been a second.
       The sum of their sensations to a second:
CANTO THE SECOND.
       Waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond
       With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond
     Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;
       As if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,
       Heaven knows how long—no doubt they never reckon'd;
     The last 's a miracle, and such was reckon'd,
     Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,
     (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:
       Arrived, retired to his; but to despond
       Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond
     As far as outward show may correspond;
     I won't be bail for anything beyond.
       And had retain'd his boyish look beyond
       Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,
       Buys them in marriage—and what rests beyond?
     Bestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;
       With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,
     And, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.
       At which the naval people are concern'd;
       And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;
     Until each high, heroic bosom burn'd
       'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;
     A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn'd
     'So now, my lads, for glory!'—Here he turn'd
       To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,
       And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;
       Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound
     Of folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,
       And beauteous, even where beauties most abound,
     His empire also was without a bound:
     Chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,
     One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'
     But to the narrative:—The vessel bound
       The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,
     For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound
       And this addition with such gems was bound
       Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,
       Even in the country circle's narrow bound
     One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,
       Yet deem'd herself in common pity bound,
     With her then, as in humble duty bound,
       Was hardly long enough; but Baba found
     Who died two days before, and now had found
     Because he had journey'd fifty miles, and found
       Some would not deem such women could be found;
     And such they are—and such they will be found:
       ('Tis an old Norman name, and to be found
     Professions, too, are no more to be found
     After the usual process, might be found
     But let it go:—it will one day be found
     When Newton saw an apple fall, he found
       The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,
     For any further answer that he found,
       'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:
       Commodious but immoral, they are found
     A 'wood obscure,' like that where Dante found
     This was an awkward test, as Juan found,
       And hastily—as nothing can confound
     Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
       Some look'd perplex'd, and others look'd profound;
     The pumps, and there were four feet water found.
     So that the heir apparent still was found
     Her neck alone was seen, but that was found
     In some exotic garden sometimes found,
     Moons changing had roll'd on, and changeless found
       Just then; as they are rather numerous found,
     Under the bed they search'd, and there they found—
     I can't tell why she blush'd, nor can expound
     Then rising haughtily he glanced around,
       A tide of well-clad waiters, and around
     Many and beautiful lay those around,
       He started; and perceiving smiles around
       From all the 'squires and 'squiresses around,
     With her Son in her blessed arms, look'd round,
     Her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,
     A mode of proving that the earth turn'd round
     As thus Juanna spoke, Dudu turn'd round
       Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)
     Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,
     They open'd windows, gazing if the ground
     Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,
       Fair Adeline, with eyes fix'd on the ground
     'T is said (for I 'll not answer above ground
     'No—only two at present above ground:
     My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.
     Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;
     Our ridicules are kept in the back-ground—
     This he discreetly kept in the background,
     An unknown barren beach for burial ground.
     'My third-'—'Your third!' quoth Juan, turning round;
     When this world shall be former, underground,
     She made the earth below seem holy ground.
     Whose every battle-field is holy ground,
       Pervades a moment those who listen round;
     So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,
     As rarely they beheld throughout their round;
     He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,
     And then they stared each other's faces round:
     They should at least have fifty rubles round,
       Whisper'd another, and thus it went round,
       Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,
     But if she were deliver'd safe and sound,
     Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,
       An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;
     The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound
       Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;
     At length she said, that in a slumber sound
     And then he had an ear for music's sound,
     How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!
     With gentle force her white arms he unwound,
       Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,
       Especially as he had been renown'd
     Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crown'd
     No less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd.
       That soon his head was most completely crown'd,
       Since first her majesty was singly crown'd:
       Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;
     Baked, fried, or burnt, turn'd inside-out, or drown'd,
       The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown'd—
       The Misses bridled, and the matrons frown'd;
     I wonder (although Mars no doubt 's a god
     Save that her duty both to man and God
     Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god
     Who were accustom'd, as a sort of god,
       At least nine tenths of what we call so;—God
     'She also recommended him to God,
       Or 'sultan,' as the author (to whose nod
     For every thing seem'd resting on his nod,
       For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;
       Or Regent, who admires such kind of food.
       Who were not quite so fond of animal food;
       With temperance in pleasure, as in food,
     And who should die to be his fellow's food.
       Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;
     And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
     So that a suit or action were made good,
     The ghost at least had done him this much good,
       The devil 's in the urchin, and no good—
     Baba eyed Juan, and said, 'Be so good
       Love, though good always, is not quite so good),
     And works of the same pottery, bad or good,
     (The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,
     I wonder if his appetite was good?
       Although no doubt his real intent was good,
       (This old song and new simile holds good),
     All kinds of toil, save for our country's good—
     Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,
       Of 'single blessedness,' and thought it good
       Himself in at the age when all grow good;
       For I maintain that it is really good,
       For something better, if not wholly good;
     And when you add to this, her womanhood
     The sable Friar in his solemn hood.
       But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,
       As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.
       For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,—
       Forth into something much like flesh and blood.
     It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,
     And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,
     Then turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood
       Will there, as also in the ties of blood,
     Now thaw'd into a marsh of human blood.
       Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
     But still we moderns equal you in blood;
       His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,
     I 'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood,
     With their green faces fix'd upon the flood.
     And love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'
     As for a brook to cope with ocean's flood;
       Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,
     Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;—
     As not being in a masquerading mood,
       And tune the concord to a finer mood.
       Who can have put my master in this mood?
       But never in his real and serious mood;
     Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,
     Not always signs with him of calmest mood:
     The woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood
     With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,
     High and inscrutable the old man stood,
       But then, I beg it may be understood,
       However little both are understood
     When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
     Had Catherine and the sultan understood
       And your true feelings fully understood,
     And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood
     To where the last Caesarean fortress stood,
     And here and there some stern high patriot stood,
       She dream'd a dream, of walking in a wood—
       He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;
     But getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'
     Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood,
       His home deserted for the lonely wood,
     Exactly as you please, or not,—the rod;
     Who did not quit me when Oppression trod
     Off, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.
     So that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,
     And the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.
     And when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd
     And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd
       "Go," and he goeth; "come," and forth he stepp'd.
     And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd
     But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,
     Next with a virgin zone he was equipp'd,
     And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.
     Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,
     For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,
       Is heaven, and heaven is love:'—so sings the bard;
       Had been call'd 'Jemmy,' after the great bard;
       But such a godfather 's as good a card.
     Intentions,' which form all mankind's trump card,
       Received instructions how to play his card,
     Thirdly, that 'Juan had more brain than beard,
     And begg'd by every hair of Mahomet's beard,
     A thing which each endearment more endear'd.
     Some hoped things might not turn out as they fear'd;
     She would revoke the order he had heard.
     And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,
     And tried to perch, although it saw and heard
     From them, at least, their destiny he heard,
       Unto by Sawney's violin, we have heard:
       The party a slight glance, then said, 'I have heard
       Can never be described; we all have heard,
     'T is wonderful how oft the sex have heard
       With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;
     To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard,—
       Nor offer'd any; she had never heard
     That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;
     Some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;
       And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard
     And even that he had so rarely heard,
       In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,
     Most love, possession, unto them appear'd
     He saw some fellow captives, who appear'd
     Next, that 'he never judged from what appear'd,
     In Sicily (all singers, duly rear'd
       Suspicion: though not timid, his regard
       To come off handsomely in that regard.
       Which meet the gaze whate'er it may regard—
       And though the duty wax'd a little hard,
       And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
       So that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard:
       When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;
       (A thing with poetry in general hard).
       Until their very number makes men hard
     Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,
     The eunuch made a sign to those on board,
     To save one half the people then on board.
     Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,
       In vain the yell of victory is roar'd
       To shield himself than put you on your guard:
       Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
     'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward
       At once her royal splendour, and reward
       Turn'd back within its socket,—these reward
       For love, war, or ambition, which reward
       But modesty 's at times its own reward,
       His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:
       Though he deserved it well for being so backward,
       His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:
       The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;
       A child of Chancery, that Star Chamber ward
     The statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer—ward
       Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,
     But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd
     A little 'blase'—'t is not to be wonder'd
       And 'gainst those few your annalists have thunder'd;
     Their column, though the Turkish batteries thunder'd
       The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder'd;
     Young women, and correct them when they blunder'd.
     But as it happens to brave men, they blunder'd—
     And naturally thought they could have plunder'd
     If that my Pegasus should not be founder'd,
     The circle smiled, then whisper'd, and then sneer'd;
       Were laid aside; but not before she offer'd
       Of modesty declined the assistance proffer'd:
       Though by this politesse she rather suffer'd,
     The branching stag swept down with all his herd,
       The Turks at first pretended to have scamper'd,
     That Johnson and some few who had not scamper'd,
       The city, without being farther hamper'd;
     Further, old Baba rather briskly enter'd.
     By the resistance of the chase they batter'd.
     He found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter'd
     And in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,
     Or Greek—that is, although it not much matter'd,
     Next they—he being naked, save a tatter'd
       Lord Henry said his muffin was ill butter'd;
       And look'd at Juan hard, but nothing utter'd.
       Herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd
     The history of divorces, which, though chequer'd,
     And then they look'd around them and despair'd,
     To quaff a brook which murmur'd like a bird.
     And her voice was the warble of a bird,
     About this time a beautiful white bird,
       And flew to her young mate like a young bird;
       And where is 'Fum' the Fourth, our 'royal bird?'
       He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,
     But others, who were left with scarce a third,
       The other two are women, and the third
       Where 's Whitbread? Romilly? Where 's George the Third?
CANTO THE THIRD.
     With which the winds of heaven can claim accord,
     Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
     Calls Ilion's the first damages on record.
       But I 'm too great a patriot to record
       At least to those of incomes which afford
     Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;
     And Catherine, who loved all things (save her lord,
     The family vault receives another lord.
     Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
       Perhaps a little later, her great lord,
     But these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,
     He—being a man who seldom used a word
     Juan, who did not understand a word
     Now Juan could not understand a word,
     Of Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:
     'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake—not a word—
     Long dialogues—which pass'd without a word!
     Who row'd off, leaving them without a word.
       I 'd rather tell ten lies than say a word
     Away! away! 'Fresh horses!' are the word,
     A thousand scimitars await the word;
       Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word
       There 's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:
     He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,
     And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,
     (In general he surprised men with the sword)
       Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;
     A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,
     Put up, young man, put up your silly sword.'
     But always without malice: if he warr'd
       Baba thought she would faint, but there he err'd—
     And plumage (probably it might have err'd
       Of fitting out her favourites, conferr'd
     Of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;
       Their country; and as traitors are abhorr'd
       And of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;
     Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorr'd)
     Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:
     To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.
       How her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:
       When things beyond the common have occurr'd;—
     This was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,
       Or perils by a loving maid incurr'd;
     Their intense souls, into each other pour'd,
     Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd
     They wonder'd how a young man so absurd
       To bring the other three here was absurd:
     Or 'God be with you!'—and 't is not absurd
     By whose degrees all characters are class'd—
       And henceforth found himself more gaily class'd
     The column order'd on the assault scarce pass'd
       And present peril all before surpass'd,
     Swam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:
     And when those deep and burning moments pass'd,
     A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,
       'What are ye?'—'What you see us.' Briefly pass'd
     Who fain would have a mutual flame confess'd,
     Although their porter afterwards confess'd—
     Rough Johnson, the great moralist, profess'd,
     To see it—the king hiss'd, and then caress'd;
       The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd
     Then Henry turn'd to Juan, and address'd
     To Juan, who was nearest him, address'd
     The General Lascy, who had been hard press'd,
     Juan would question further, but she press'd
     Was not at first too readily impress'd.
       (See Littleton), whene'er I have express'd
       Boded no good, whatever it express'd,
     I think the foolish people were possess'd,
     A world of words, and things at which she guess'd.
     Impressions were much stronger than she guess'd,
     Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd
       My Muse despises reference, as you have guess'd
       At least we think so, though but few have guess'd
     And first a little crucifix he kiss'd,
     They either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,
     Till duly disappointed or dismiss'd:
       With the substantial company engross'd
           But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
     In senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,
     Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;
     Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,
       And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud
       Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:
     What can ye recognise?—a gilded cloud.
     The moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.
     Which arch'd the horizon like a fiery cloud,
     A mirror'd hell! the volleying roar, and loud
       No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud
       Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud—
     Serene, accomplish'd, cheerful but not loud;
     Gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud
       As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,
       To feel that flattery which attracts the proud
       Perhaps because 't was fallen: her sires were proud
     Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,
     As every rising wave his dread renew'd;
     And certainly Aurora had renew'd
     'He shall if that he dare.' Here Juan bow'd
       Of nations, and had never bent or bow'd
       Valour; much also to the blood he show'd,
       Shed its Ionian elegance, which show'd
     By all the demons of all passions, show'd
       A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd
       Which set the beauty off in which he glow'd,
       For ever since immortal man hath glow'd
     Continued: 'Your old regiment's allow'd,
       As far as her own gentle heart allow'd,
     The night was dark, and the thick mist allow'd
     Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,
     Observant of the foibles of the crowd,
       Confounded him in common with the crowd
       And raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd
       With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;
       Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,
     Or it may be to-night, the assault: I have vow'd
     Just at this instant, while their eyes were fix'd
     Unto his protege; while hers, transfix'd
     In Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mix'd
     The time must come, when both alike decay'd,
     Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flay'd.
       Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allay'd,
     Into a rivulet; and thus allay'd,
     Amidst the court a Gothic fountain play'd,
     In courtesy their wish to see display'd
     The talent and good humour he display'd,
     'Twas like the fawn, which, in the lake display'd,
     A perfect transformation here display'd;
       Indeed we see the daily proof display'd
     And a magnificent large hall display'd
     For cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,
       But various as the various meats display'd:
     To something like this when too oft display'd;
     The upper border, richly wrought, display'd,
     And rank'd with what is every day display'd—
     The negroes more philosophy display'd,—
     'T was nine, when still advancing undismay'd,
       For Juan, so that even when he pray'd
     That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.
     It was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd
     And now being femininely all array'd,
     That they must instantly be well array'd,
     A child of Nature, carelessly array'd:
       The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd
     Anon—she was released, and then she stray'd
       Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd
       And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:
     Look'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,
       An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;
     Which flatters, but is flattery convey'd
     At seven they rose, however, and survey'd
       And not much sympathy for blood, survey'd
       Of nations freed, and the world overjoy'd,
     Contented, when translated, means but cloy'd;
     A something wherewithal to be annoy'd.
       Which ever the destroyer yet destroy'd,
     'Rx Pulv Com gr. iij. Ipecacuanhae'
           To make a new Thermopylae!
     Aq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae
     They wonder'd how Gulbeyaz, too, could be
       If any laughter at such times could be,
       But not as yet imagined it could be
     His blood less noble than such blood should be;
       Will join your former regiment, which should be
       Summers could renovate, though they should be
       By a distant organ, doubting if he be
       A proud humility, if such there be,
     And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
     You please (it causes all the things which be,
       Must be recited, and—without a bribe.
     Unless some beauty with a kiss should bribe.
     'T is that, in fact, there 's little to describe.
     Is more than I shall venture to describe,
       To you the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe
       But which 't is time to teach the hireling tribe
     The real portrait of the highest tribe?
     Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,
       What are we? and whence came we? what shall be
     What Juan saw and underwent shall be
     The servile and the vain, such names will be
     'Give us more grog,' they cried, 'for it will be
     She was as capable as woman can be.
       (To save description), fair as fair can be
     And then I have the worst dreams that can be,
     But of such friendship as man's may to man be
     His cap and head, which proves the head to be
       Her hair had silver only, bound to be
       And all within its arch appear'd to be
     He deems it is his proper place to be;
     But dreams of what has been, no more to be.
     A throne, the world, the universe, to be
     In this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be
       The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be
     Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)
     They were alone once more; for them to be
     So Cowper says—and I begin to be
       Who, though they prove not two and two to be
       Where I beheld what never was to be;
     Said Juan: 'Whatsoever is to be
       Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be;
     My poem 's epic, and is meant to be
       Had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,
       That made his eyelids as a woman's be,
     Be hypocritical, be cautious, be
       Caress'd him often—such a thing might be
       But Juan, season'd, as he well might be,
     Certainly aged—what her years might be
       His youth was not the chastest that might be,
     With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,
       Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be
       And those that sate upon them, let it be
       Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,
       Though foe to love; and yet they could not be
       But that 's impossible, and cannot be—
     'If it should be so,—but—it cannot be—
     Their roar even with the Baltic's—so you be
     A moment at the door, that we may be
       Whatever follows ne'ertheless may be
       To turn out both, or either, it may be.
       The tumulus—of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be
       And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;
           Where grew the arts of war and peace,
       But at this hour I wish to part in peace,
     T is true he had no ardent love for peace—
     With all the promise of as fine a face
       'T is so becoming to the soul and face,
       The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
     Also because the figure and the face
     On such a subject; then suppose the face
     One or two stared the captives in the face,
     There 's nothing so becoming to the face.
       Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:
     Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face.
     Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.
     My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.
     Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,
     The door was fasten'd in his legal face.
       For Juan wore the magisterial face
     With Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face,
       A frown on Nature's or on human face;
     The latest, Juan with his virgin face.
     And Haidee met the morning face to face;
       But there were she and Juan, face to face—
     Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,
     Was obvious in each feature of her face,
     And she was chill as they, and on her face
     If she had any, was upon her face,
     The women pardon'd all except her face.
       Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;
       And so they fell in love;—she with his face,
     But with a heavenly rapture on his face.
     And gazing on the dead, she thought his face
          His form you may trace, but not his face,
       Still kept his spirits up—at least his face;
       He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.
     Her father's blood before her father's face
       Nothing could make her meet her father's face,
     Records Ravenna's carnage on its face,
     A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,
     But certes matters took a different face;
             Even as I sing, suffuse my face;
       Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;
     The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,
     And so it was, in proper time and place;
     Within a cannon-shot length of the place
       Unless he wish'd to die upon the place—
       Avail'd for either; neither change of place,
       With all the lakers, in and out of place?
       But still no less suspects in the wrong place,
     Yes; she was truly worthy her high place!
       How this same interview had taken place,
       For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace
       Expurgated by learned men, who place
     Except the Whigs not getting into place.
     Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.
       Or earth beneath, or heaven, or t' other place;
     Juan presented in the proper place,
     While t'other half were laid down in their place
       Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:
       As some have qualified that wondrous place:
       Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place
       Thou art in London—in that pleasant place,
     You 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,
       And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.
     Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
     Thus he profanely term'd the finest lace
     And was received with all the due grimace
     Rush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace,
       His travels to the capital apace;—
     Just as old age is creeping on apace,
       When her soft, liquid words run on apace,
       With the first draught intoxicates apace,
     He studied steadily, and grew apace,
       And then moved on again with rapid pace;
     A moment without slackening from their pace;
     They counted thirty, crowded in a space
       A half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space
       And wear the Melton jacket for a space:
       In twelve hours' time, and very little space,
     And all the stars that crowded the blue space
     Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.
       Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,
       To build a college, or to found a race,
     Dash'd on like a spurr'd blood-horse in a race.
     And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,
     There was a depth of feeling to embrace
     As the black eunuch enter'd with his brace
       Exclaiming;—'Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace
     Houris, or aught except his florid race
       Which can await warm youth in its wild race.
       Saint from his beads to join the jocund race;
             Though link'd among a fetter'd race,
       As one who, though he were not of the race,
       And representative of all the race.
     Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race
     Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,
     The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
     And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,
     Young Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;
       And bore him with some gaiety and grace,
       To hunt our errors up with a good grace?
       You had reason; 't was that a young child of grace,
       And rich with all contrivances which grace
     With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;
     When he beheld his latest hero grace
      The guests dropped in, the last but one, Her Grace,
     She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,
       Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,
     Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,
     The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,
     Some praised her beauty; others her great grace;
       So recollect that the extremest grace
       December's drowsy day to his dull race,—
     Nought 's permanent among the human race,
       And far away, the last bud of her race,
     Her fate had been to that of all her race;
     Boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.
       Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace
       She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;
     In whom our brightest days we would retrace,
     Like to her father's features, till each trace—
     Had scarr'd her brow, and left its crimson trace,
       Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
       By deep emotion:—you may sometimes trace
     A little turn for mischief you might trace
     No lips e'er left their transitory trace;
     Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece
     But something of the spirit of old Greece
                     THE ISLES OF GREECE.
           The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
     Of conduct was which he observed in Greece.
     Meknop, Serge Lwow, Arsniew of modern Greece,
     Madrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.
     To 'do at Rome as Romans do,' a piece
     And others of twelve consonants apiece;
     They also gave a petticoat apiece,

     When once you have broken their confounded ice.
     Then there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;—
     Why Adeline had this slight prejudice—
     Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.
     Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;—
     Like a good ship entangled among ice,
     Fearless, because no feeling dwells in ice;
     For me appears a question far too nice,
     The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.

     'For his own part, he really should rejoice
     Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice
     Of human nature's agonising voice!
     And if I had to give a casting voice,
     I 'll not gainsay the generous public's voice,
     An arrow for the heart like a sweet voice.
     The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,
     I think I must take up with avarice.
     She thought upon the subject twice or thrice,
       And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;
     Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price
     Only to keep its corn at the old price.
     The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
     Compared with those of our pure pearls of price,
     Of all experience 't is the usual price,
     And what not, though he rode beyond all price,
     And your cold people are beyond all price,
     Although no doubt it was beyond all price.
     Yet in the very centre, past all price,
     'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'
       Just as one views a horse to guess his price;
       Since gold alone should not have been its price.
     For which small thanks are still the market price,
     I 'll have another figure in a trice:—
     Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,
     Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,
     Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.
     Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,
     Frozen into a very vinous ice,

     Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,
     Where juniper expresses its best juice,
       Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,
     Its very courage stagnates to a vice.
     'That good but rarely came from good advice.'
     None can say that this was not good advice,
     She had a good opinion of advice,
     And after so much excellent advice.
     And that 's one comfort for my lost advice,
     Ah, if you had but follow'd my advice!'
     Because it is a marketable vice.
     As pure as sanctity itself from vice,
     Has quite the contrary effect on vice.
     Embarrass'd at first starting with a novice.
     Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,

     Consulting 'the Society for Vice

     So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
     And angling, too, that solitary vice,

     And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,
     But after being fired at once or twice,
     That is—the Lady:' clapping his hands twice,
     Consoling us with—'Would you had thought twice!

     They thought that in such perils, more than chance
       As on the whole it is an even chance
       But could we know them in detail, perchance
       With joy to save, and dread of some mischance
       War's merit it by no means might enhance,
     I think that with this holy new alliance
       By a look scarce perceptibly askance
       The moments when we gather from a glance
       And usual—Juan, when he cast a glance
       Upon each other, with dilated glance,
       Without the farce of friendship, or romance
       That Juan had enough of maintenance,
     May not think much of London's first appearance—
     Had sent them this for their deliverance.
       Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,
     To see in forts of Netherlands or France
     The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance
       The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance
       With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,
       A single shade 's sufficient to entrance
       Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance
       And pass'd for arguments of good endurance.
      Patient, but not enamoured of endurance;
       A modest confidence and calm assurance,
       Modest I am, yet with some slight assurance;
     Had cost his enemies a long repentance,
       Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;
     And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.
     The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance
       Her second, to cut only his—acquaintance;
       And Juan's suite, late scatter'd at a distance,
     The lightest being the safest: at a distance
     Of poets who come down to us through distance
     Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.
     He motion'd them to stop at some small distance,
     A sad miscalculation about distance
     When gazing on them, mystified by distance,
     So was his blood stirr'd while he found resistance,
     And giving up all notions of resistance,
       And offering, as usual, late assistance.
     The match was lit too soon, and no assistance
     'T is as a snowball which derives assistance
       The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;
       As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.
     But those who scaled, found out that their advance
       To thus much Adeline would not advance;
     While this high post of honour 's in abeyance,
     You 'll mount with our young hero the conveyance
       This liberty is a poetic licence,

     There winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,
     Embark'd himself and them, and off they went thence
     All other magazines of art or science,
     And if their approbation we experience,
     By specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,
     Gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,
     I said that Lambro was a man of patience,
     As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,
       Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,
     And then he tried to muster all his patience.
     Resigns herself with exemplary patience
     And young beginners may as well commence
     On which they might repose, or even commence
     Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)
     Juan replied, with all becoming deference,
     Of Dudu, though they held their tongues from deference.
     But that, at present, with immediate reference
       And only think, or act, or feel, with reference
     Some difficulties, as in his own preference,
     The others pouting at the matron's preference
       Of which the latter merits every preference
       Upon the whole is greater than the difference
     Aurora, who in her indifference
     Aurora sat with that indifference
     A hidden nectar under a cold presence.
       Is pleasant, besides being true love's essence,
     'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;
       At present I am glad of a pretence
       He danced without theatrical pretence,
     Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,
     Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence
     They look'd like persons being led to sentence,
       Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence
     Who little thought that his own crack'd existence
     Or double post and rail, where the existence
     Three fireships lost their amiable existence
     Life seems the smallest portion of existence;
     We enter on our nautical existence.
     They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,
       As if his veins would pour out his existence,
       Sultana, think upon the consequence:
       The serious Angles in the eloquence
       Insisting on removal of the prince
       And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since—
     Permits whate'er they please, or did not long since.
       But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):
       The General Markow, who could thus evince
       All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,
     And though 't is true that man can only die once,
       Which, as all spoke at once and more than once,
     Broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,
     And all mistook about the latter once.
     Moreover I 've remark'd (and I was once
     When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,
     The voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once
     In one wide wound pour'd forth his soul at once.
     Which makes us wish ourselves in town at once;—
     Barouche, which had the glory to display once
     A wise man more than laughter from a dunce—
     And so may every one except a dunce,
     Could hardly be united by a dunce.
       Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce
     And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,
     And much more tender on the whole than fierce;
     But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,
     One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:'
     Resolved to thrust the mystery carte and tierce,
     But her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,
     A lad of sixteen causing a divorce
     And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
       The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,
     Though sleeping like a lion near a source.
       And feeling, in a poet, is the source
     The lash to Baba:—but her grand resource
     He scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource
     Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
     This monstrous tale had probably its source
       And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,
       Because he ne'er seem'd anxious to seduce;
     Yet as they founded churches with the produce,
     And likes particularly to produce
       Are topics which I sometimes introduce,
       Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce
     The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade
       But the fair face which met his eyes forbade
     And he stood gazing out on the cascade
     Its outlet dash'd into a deep cascade,
     A slight example, just to cast a shade
             Our virgins dance beneath the shade—
     That flash'd and after darken'd in the shade.
       By their possessors thrown into the shade:
     Thus Adeline would throw into the shade
     Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,
       And natural agonies, with a slight shade
       We only can but talk of escalade,
     The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade
     And brought before the empress, who had made
       As even in a much humbler lot had made
     Conspiracy or congress to be made,
     By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.
     And stumbled almost every step she made;
     And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
       Had further sleep a further pleasure made;
     The spring gush'd through grim mouths of granite made,
       Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made
     The town was enter'd: first one column made
       A general object of attention, made
     In perfect innocence she then unmade
       Or but at times a little supper made;
     His garments only a slight murmur made;
       The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,
     'The best first speech that ever yet was made.'
       Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,
     Its shriller echoes—like an infant made
       Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made
     A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made
     'But add the words,' cried Henry, 'which you made;
       If Homer had found mortars ready made;
     The hangings of the room were tapestry, made
     Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,
       In preparations for a cannonade
     Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,
       Where'er collective wisdom can parade,
     The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.
     Quite orderly, as if upon parade.
       That is, with thirty servants for parade,
     What dilettanti do with vast parade)
     To all she was polite without parade;
       In tricking her out for a masquerade;
       And yet last night, being at a masquerade,
       And vegetables, all in masquerade,
     Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,
     Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;
     As if well used to the retreating trade;
     A bungler even in its disgusting trade,
     Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,
       As if born for the ministerial trade.
       Men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade
       For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.
     O'er the entrenchment and the palisade,
     Which needed not an empire to persuade,
       Stopp'd as if once more willing to concede
       Such measures as she thought might best impede
       Or for the sake of decency abide
     'To be, or not to be?'—Ere I decide,
       The world, not the world's masters, will decide,
       This I must leave sultanas to decide:
     Voltaire says 'No:' he tells you that Candide
       Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide
     But there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,
       Look where you please—we 've nothing, sir, to hide;
     For me on earth, except some years to hide
     On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,
     Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!
       Of what she had gone through with—since a bride.
       It was for this that I became a bride!
     To break the rules by bringing one's own bride
       Of import both to virgin and to bride,
     (If that his Highness wearied of his bride)
       The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,
       And, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride,
       Upon an heiress or his neighbour's bride,
     Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:
     Though at the first I might perchance deride
       O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:
     Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,
       Though pale with conflicts between love and pride;—
       But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:
     The devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?
     'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
     Who now are basking in their full-blown pride
       And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;
     Trampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,
       At wassail in their beauty and their pride:
       And (should she not hold fast by love or pride)
       To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,
     No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
     Despite her injured love and fiery pride;
       That somewhat manly majesty of stride,
     By bidding others carry while they ride.
     Required. Aurora scarcely look'd aside,
       Which makes not others smile; then turn'd aside:
     He mutter'd (but the last was given aside)
       Was on the point of being set aside:
     Now this (but we will whisper it aside)
     These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
     Her throne and power, and every thing beside.
     Dudu said nothing, but sat down beside
       George Washington had thanks and nought beside,
     Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.
       To swing a little less from side to side,
     For my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,
     But scarce a fee was paid on either side
       Of a huge hall, and on its either side
     But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;
     In other vehicles; but at his side
       To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,—
       And seated her all drooping by his side,
     Be ready by the secret portal's side:
       A rib 's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,
       A husband like Alfonso at my side;
       You saw that she was sleeping by my side
     By mowing Christians down on every side,
       Before them, and fair slaves on every side;
     But just suppose that moment should betide,
     What may this midnight violence betide,
       And stood within his hall at eventide;
       Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide—
       So let us back to Lilliput, and guide
       They follow'd close behind their sable guide,
       His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,
       Though once she was seen reading the 'Bath Guide,'
     A pretty stranger without friend or guide,
     In this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.
       To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:
     Which mortals generously would divide,
     'T is true we speculate both far and wide,
       And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,
     He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide

     She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,

     Of living in their insular abode.
       A taste seen in the choice of his abode,
     'We must be near some place of man's abode;—
       Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
       And settled bonnets by the newest code,
     Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode
       If this be true; for we must deem the mode
     Their work even by the way in which he trode.
       Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,
       What went before—by way of episode,
     Society is now one polish'd horde,

       Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude
       To bear these crosses) for each waning prude
     Until 'tis taught by lessons rather rude,
       As several people think such hazards rude.
     Of human years, that half-way house, that rude
       So much indeed as to be downright rude;
       Where nought upon their passion could intrude,
     Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,
     With Thought;—and of Thought's foes by far most rude,
     Sweet hour of twilight!—in the solitude
       His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
       Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,
     'Go, little book, from this my solitude!
       The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,
       When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude:
     And since 'there 's safety in a multitude
       And take what kings call 'an imposing attitude,'
     With much suspicion in his attitude;
       Herself in her sublimest attitude:
       But visions of an apple and a bee,
     None, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,
     For a spoil'd carpet—but the 'Attic Bee'
     Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:
     He had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,
     Came always back to coffee and Haidee.
     But Zoe, being older than Haidee,
       Dear as her father had been to Haidee,
     And thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee
       High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;
       And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee
     The surgeon, as there was no other fee,
     Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
       That he was not an ancient debauchee
     How have I loved the twilight hour and thee!
     O Doubt!—if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee;
     But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?
     When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!
       Or think of any thing excepting thee;
       Beneath the lie this state-thing breathed o'er thee.
       How much I have loved—that I love not thee!
     That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!
       And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,
     Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.
       The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee—
     Damm'd from its fountain—the child from the knee
     The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;
       But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
     Some fine examples of the epopee,
       As if each charming word were a decree.
       (For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree
       As though the lurking thought had follow'd free.
     A watchword till the future shall be free.
             I dream'd that Greece might still be free;
     As yet are strongly stinging to be free.
     I do not know;—I wish men to be free
     The stars from out the sky, than not be free
     Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,
       Went bounding for the island of the free,
       Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!
       This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:
     (See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.
       A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:
     Felt most indignant still at not being free.
     The free-born forest found and kept them free,
       Wax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,
       And taught him when to be reserved or free:
     Show'd what things were before the world was free!
       Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'
       Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;
     But that you won't—then don't—I am not less free.
       If we should strike a stroke to set us free;
       Began to think the duchess' conduct free;
     Malthus and Wilberforce:—the last set free
       So says the proverb—and I quite agree;
       Though differing in stature and degree,
     In that point so precise in each degree
     I have named a few, not foremost in degree,
     Good people all, of every degree,
     And a young race-horse of old pedigree
     She married (I forget the pedigree)
     And oaks as olden as their pedigree
     And worthy of the noblest pedigree
       For if my pure libations exceed three,
       Save one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,
       Have plainly made it out that four are three,
     New characters; the episodes are three:
       Of sentimental friendship, there were three,
     Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.
       And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;
     And measures round of toises thousands three.
       The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,
           Of the three hundred grant but three,
       'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?'
       When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;
     Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.
     The party might consist of thirty-three
       On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;
     And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.
       The earth, which he became like a fell'd tree,
     Weary, unless when separate: the tree
     Of thine imaginary deathless tree,
     Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree
     Told of their sires, a tomb in every tree.
       The salmi, the consomme, the puree,
       So much distrait he was, that all could see
       'And wonder what old world such things could see,
     Which out of all the lovely things we see
       (For such exaggerations here and there I see)
     Replied Katinka; 'I am sure I see
     I have seen more than I 'll say:—but we will see
     Just in the way we very often see.
     Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.
     Catherine, I say, was very glad to see
     Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see
       The good old khan, who long had ceased to see
       Not what they saw, but what they wish'd to see:
     Or I at least shall not survive to see.'
       Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see
       Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see
       With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see
     But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,
     Senseless to feel, and with seal'd eyes to see.
     Match'd for the spring, whom several went to see.
       Water, and wine, and food,—and you might see
       You surely are unwell, child! we must see,
     Not what you seem, but always what you see.
       Cadiz perhaps—but that you soon may see;
     In that remote recess which you may see—
     Was much consoled by his own repartee.
     She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,
     I leave Don Juan for the present, safe—
       And haggard with a dissipated life,
       The baser sides of literature and life,
     Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life
     'But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,
     Round her she made an atmosphere of life,
     'T is very certain the desire of life
     They honour'd such determined scorn of life.
     And pass'd (at least the latter years of life)
     From holding up the nothingness of life?
       For some time an unhappy sort of life,
       Than many persons more advanced in life;
     And tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,
     And timidly expanding into life.
     If all the dead could now return to life
     Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life
     With,—'Damn your eyes! your money or your life!'
     She did this during even her husband's life—
     He would have written sonnets all his life?
     Here-' he was interrupted by a knife,
     Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife
       The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,
     When demagogues would with a butcher's knife
     They were so soft and beautiful, and rife
     To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife
       And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
       Last carnival she made a deal of strife
     Must I restrain me, through the fear of strife,
       By those who scour those double vales of strife.
     But could he quit his king in times of strife,
     For Death, though vanquish'd, still retired with strife.
     Flow'd from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,
       At quitting even those we quit in strife,
     No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,
     The mortal and the marble still at strife,
     And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife—
     Into that moral centaur, man and wife?
       They lived respectably as man and wife,
       His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,
     When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,
     Will hardly leave you (as she 's not your wife)
     Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
     For instance, if a husband or his wife
       Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,
     For being a most exemplary wife.
     I recommend as much to every wife.
     If they were fitted for the purposed cage:
     Besides, he was of that delighted age
       Think what it is to be in your old age
       Has not the natural stays of strict old age;
     The captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age,
       Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age—
       Which is most barbarous is the middle age
     But what we can we glean in this vile age
     But Adeline was far from that ripe age,
     Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,
       And happiest they who horses can engage;
     We don't much care with whom we may engage,
     Kindling Religion till she throws down her gage,
     Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,
     There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage
       It adds an outward grace unto their carriage—
     But Juan now is stepping from his carriage
       Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.
     To bear a son and heir—and one miscarriage.
       And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;
     Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,
     Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;
       All comedies are ended by a marriage;
     When Rapp the Harmonist embargo'd marriage
     Useful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.-
     She had also snatch'd a moment since her marriage
       And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;
       A peril—not indeed like love or marriage,
     That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
       Who say strange things for so correct an age;
     Or brigantine, or pink, of no great tonnage,
     While yet America was in her non-age.
     Just now a black old neutral personage
     Who, in his common-place book, had a page
     Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
       A period something like a printed page,
       Especially upon a printed page.
       Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!
       Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;
       And therefore leave them to the purer page
       But then they shone not on the poet's page,
     As I have said in—I forget what page;
     Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
     The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.
     Without those sad expenses which disparage
       The postboys have no reason to disparage
       It is—I meant and mean not to disparage
       For authors fear description might disparage
       For when they happen at a riper age,
       To match a common fury with her rage,
       He who hath proved war, storm, or woman's rage,
       A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,
     To be a totus teres stoic, sage,
       But when we hover between fool and sage,
       And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
       And wonder Providence is not more sage.
     (Though Parry's efforts look a lucky presage),
     I must not quite omit the talking sage,
     Was Juan,—who, an awkward thing at his age,
     Pair'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage.
     'T was rather her experience made her sage,
     But after all they are a North-West Passage
     And as the good ships sent upon that message
       Was very young, although so very sage,
       Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;
       But can't find any in the present age
     Bright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,
     A page where Time should hesitate to print age,
     But Adeline was of the purest vintage,
     So that we can our native sun assuage
       Which is still better; thus in verse to wage
       My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,
     In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
     Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge.
     For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.
     Of twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge,—
     Had set some time, and night was on the ridge
     Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.
     No—no—I 'd send him out betimes to college,
     Always premising that said son at college
     Serenely savage, with a little change
     When he was gone, there was a sudden change:
     How oft would vice and virtue places change!
       Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;
     For into a prime minister but change
     How much would novels gain by the exchange!
     Of tumbling first, and having in exchange
       Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange
     Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range
     But Juan had been early taught to range
       Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange
     But he, more modest, took an humbler range
       And few there are whom these cannot estrange;
     Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,
     He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange
     A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;
       Although his situation now seems strange
     'T is strange,—but true; for truth is always strange;
     But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,
       'T is woman's whole existence; man may range
     For she, too, was as one who could avenge,
       Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge
       To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,
     The hearts of the heroic on a charge,
     But now I must transfer her to the charge
     Of Danube's bank took formidable charge;
       He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,
       Our hero gladly saw his little charge
     Also the solace of an overcharge.
     A goodly guardian for his infant charge,
     Of Lolah—though her couch is not so large.'
     Hawk'd about at a discount, small or large;
     Who might not profit much by being at large.
       Being long married, and thus set at large,
       Than he, in these sad highways left at large
     As leaving a small family at large.
     Don Juan, here permitted to emerge
       Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,
       'Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge.
     Two batteries, cap-a-pie, as our St. George,
     But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,
     Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge
     Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,
       How less what we may be! The eternal surge
     May choose between the headache and the heartache.
     Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache
     A lamp burn'd high, while he leant from a niche,
     Some favour'd object; and as in the niche
     Or Swiss Rousseau, cry 'Voila la Pervenche!'
     But this won't do, save by and by; and he
     Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he
     Because 't is so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he
     Were link'd alike, as for the common people he
     And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he
     At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he
       Into Don Juan's head a thought, which he
       For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he
     But oft denied, as patience 'gins to fail, he
     Such plentiful precautions, that still he

     'T is to retort with firmness, and when he

       In his rough eyes, and told the captain he
     Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he
       And he himself obliged to shut up shop—he
     Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He
       And look'd down over Attica; or he
       And still a sort of fisherman was he;
       'Well, then, your third,' said Juan; 'what did she?
     He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,
     I shall have much to speak about), and she
     And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she
       You must excuse this extract, 't is where she,
       Fired with an abstract love of virtue, she,
     'Besides, I hate to sleep alone,' quoth she.
     In prison,—but the gaoler, what is he?
       With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he
     And as he rush'd along, it came to pass he
     Besides, so very beautiful was she,
     With a young benefactress,—so was she,
     And lo! a fifth appears;—and what is she?
       But of inferior materials: she
     Sagest of women, even of widows, she
     But no one doubted on the whole, that she
     And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,
       Julia was sent into a convent: she
     Droop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,
     In lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,
       Some days and nights elapsed before that he
       Started the stern-post, also shatter'd the
     What a sublime discovery 't was to make the
     That all 's ideal—all ourselves: I 'll stake the
     Instead of gliding graciously down Lethe,
     The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he

     He who has nought to gain can have small art: he

     Since, in a way that 's rather of the oddest, he

     Nor even Diogenes.—We live and die,
             There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
     And strives to strangle him before he die.
       Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;
     My debt in being thus allow'd to die
       And place them on their breast—but place to die—
     All things that have been born were born to die,
     Except perhaps that you were born to die?
     Deepest in those who long the most to die.
     Save theirs, and that their life could never die.
     Avouch'd his death (such people never die),
       That some, I really think, do never die;
     Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.
       A fact without some leaven of a lie.
     Even my veracious self?—But that 's a lie:
     Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.
       Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,
     He did not know (alas! how men will lie)
     While life's strange principle will often lie
     Feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie
     'You, Lolah, must continue still to lie
     In this: whatever other blunders lie
       To his own circumstances, there might lie
       (The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),
     Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,
     Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:—
       Blue as the garters which serenely lie
     Began to treat him with some small 'agacerie.'
     There is but one superb menagerie.
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'
       By the mere combination of a coterie;
     Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.
     Observing little in his reverie,
       And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'
       He had a predilection for that tie;
       The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.
     The outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.
     Before the mansion lay a lucid lake,
     More than I have myself of what could make
     Save on the dead long summer days, which make
       She felt it going, and resolved to make
     The henna should be deeply dyed to make
       For Haidee stripped her sables off to make
       And left at large, like a young heir, to make
     Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
     Which some irregularity may make
     But these are few, and in the end they make
     Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.
       Of them his lips imperial ever spake!
     And then men stare, as if a new ass spake
       As travellers follow over bog and brake
     Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake
       For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;
     So that I trust for everybody's sake,
     By a river, which its soften'd way did take
       O! Mahomet! that his majesty should take
     Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,
       Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;
     But here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:
     The Lady Adeline resolved to take
       Reserve it) will be very sure to take.
     Till pausing at the last her breath to take,
       Enlargement of existence to partake
     A strange sensation which she must partake
       Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,
     But innocence is bold even at the stake,
       For instance—gentlemen, whose ladies take
       Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)
     They also lie too—under a mistake.
     The farther progress of this sad mistake.
     And one by one in turn, some grand mistake
     That this disguise may lead to no mistake.'
     That even the purest people may mistake
     Though life, and death, and victory were at stake;
     I have tried both; so those who would a part take
     Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take—
     To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake
       And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
     Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
       But then the thought of parting made her quake;
       And warm, in case by chance he should awake,
     To stir her viands, made him quite awake
     The eye might doubt if it were well awake,
     That sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.
     Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!
       To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:
     She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,
     The calm Dudu so turbulently wake.
     I have brought this world about my ears, and eke
     Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
     He fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like
     And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,
     Nor liken it—I never saw the like:
     And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.
     'As for the figuranti, they are like
     The other female's dress was not unlike,
     That painting is no idol,—'t is too like.
     But Wordsworth's poem, and his followers, like
     There 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,
     A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.
     A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,
     What though 't is but a pictured image?—strike—
     Ye glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike
     Had not so many ornaments to strike,
     Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,
     I can't describe it, though so much it strike,
     Are things which in this century don't strike
     A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,
     The phantom of her frolic Grace—Fitz-Fulke!
     Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke
     Of all save Dudu's dream, which was no joke.
     Her own but served to set off every joke,
     Which curl in curious wreaths:—how soon the smoke
     But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke
     Yet there will still be bards: though fame is smoke,
     A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,
     And thrown into the sea.—Thus Baba spoke
     But then 't was to the purpose what she spoke:
     Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke
     As on the beach the waves at last are broke,
     Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke
     True, she said little—'t was the rest that broke
       His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunderstroke;
     And Juan gazed as one who is awoke
       The dappled foresters—as day awoke,
     And the unquiet feelings, which first woke
     The gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke
     Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!
       Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke
     There was the Duke of Dash, who was a—duke,
     But what is odd, none ever named the duke,
     Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,
     He there builds up a formidable dyke
     A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale—
       A mighty mug of moral double ale.
     Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;
       Increased at night, until it blew a gale;
       Been stove in the beginning of the gale;
     Meantime the current, with a rising gale,
     Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
     With 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale,
       A man of thirty rather stout and hale,
     By nature, as in higher dames less hale
       If the soprano might be deem'd to be male,
       There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,
       Were link'd together, and it happen'd the male
       Et bene, dic neutrum, dic aliquando male.'
     Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:
       Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale
       Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.
       Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,
     The ladies—some rouged, some a little pale—
       Its kind attentions to their proper pale,
       White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:
     She look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale
       And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
     And sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;
     While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,
     She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale
     The present culprit was extremely pale,
       Her eye in passing on his way to sale;
     Had brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,
       With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,
     Or walk'd; if foul, they read, or told a tale,
     Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale
       In England a six canto quarto tale;
       Her stomach 's not her peccant part; this tale
     According to some good old woman's tale.
     Something, but what 's not stated in my tale.
       Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,
     Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable
     Young people at his time of life should be able
     And he who understands it would be able
       Discretion, and were not so peaceable
     Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable—
     The favour of the empress was agreeable;
     He was now growing up like a green tree, able
     And show that late hours, wine, and love are able
       This is a fact and no poetic fable—
     Might teach them this much better than I 'm able.
     An exquisite small chapel had been able,
     'T is said it makes reality more bearable:
     Apologue, fable, poesy, and parable,
     By those who sow them in a land that 's arable.
     The mansion's self was vast and venerable,
     O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?
     The Lady Adeline, right honourable;
       And, running out as fast as I was able,
     While the right hand which wrote it still is able,
     A thing in footing indispensable;
       Under pretence of business indispensable
     For weapons; but what Muse since Homer 's able
     To do not much less damage than the table.
       My hat and gloves still lying on the table,
     Elsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,
     For few of the soft sex are very stable
     Great things were now to be achieved at table,
     Ye who but see the saving man at table,
     Not scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable,
     Leaving such to the literary rabble:
     As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;
     And deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.
     So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
     Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.
     Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,
       Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,
       Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible
       Who bids all men believe the impossible,
     And Pegasus hath a psalmodic amble
     The Muses upon Sion's hill must ramble
     I wish they knew the life of a young noble.
     Varied each ray;—but all descriptions garble
     Mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,
     And singing birds without were heard to warble;
     Of single gentlemen who would be double.
     The single ladies wishing to be double,
     To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.
     Requires decorum, and is apt to double
     Well cultivated, it will render double.
     But though the soil may give you time and trouble,
     And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;—
     The horrid sin—and what 's still worse, the trouble.
     By many virtues, to be worth the trouble
     I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
     The married ones to save the virgins trouble.
     Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,
     Their preservation would have been a miracle.
       Is always greatest at a miracle.
       A handsome man, that human miracle;
     The third sort to be noted in our chronicle
       Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;
       'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
     Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.
     'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,
     Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,
     With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.
     Of epic Love's beginning, end, and middle.
     But now I choose to break off in the middle,
     The hero of this grand poetic riddle,
     Expounding and illustrating the riddle
       Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle
       Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle
       Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;
       And not the fix'd—he knew the way to wheedle:
       And always changed as true as any needle;
     Their moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.
     At least she left it a more slender handle.
     Must still obey the high—which is their handle,
     The starry darkness round her like a girdle
     Spangled with gems—the monk made his blood curdle.
     Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
     (For sometimes we must box without the muffle).
     But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.
     There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,
     I always knock my head against some angle
     So much as I do any kind of wrangle;
     But here again, why will I thus entangle
       In mind, a sort of sentimental bogle,
       Or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle:—
       Nought 's more sublime than energetic bile,
     The liver is the lazaret of bile,
     Quiets at once with 'quia impossibile.'
       Indeed I 've not the necessary bile;
     Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,
     First came her damsels, a decorous file,
     'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while
     For the first passion stays there such a while,
       She must not own, but cherish'd more the while
       And taking hints in good part all the while,
     And then she looks so modest all the while.
       A moment's more had slain her; but the while
     As to announce his visits a long while
     To show she could, if it were worth her while.
       Their flanks;—but it is hardly worth my while
     The train might reach a quarter of a mile:
     And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
       And bade him counsel Juan. With a smile
     Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile
       And even my Muse's worst reproof 's a smile;
     On which three single hours of moonshine smile—
       And looking on him with a sort of smile,
       Nor foes—all nations—condescend to smile.
       Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,
       She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,
     And glory long has made the sages smile;
     To such performances with haughty smile,
     A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile
     In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile—
     With some small profit through that field so sterile,
     As rare in living beings as a fossile
       Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,
       Ineffably, legitimately vile,
       Even innocence itself has many a wile,
       To wean Don Juan from the siren's wile;
       Although a female moderately fickle,
       For any length of days in such a pickle.
       Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle
       As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:
       Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,
       As any other boon for which men stickle.
     Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?
     A cure for grief—for what can ever rankle
     And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.
     Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,
     To save his fame with each accomplish'd belle,
       Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,
       New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,
     Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille.
     The Lady Adeline Amundeville
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville,
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville;
          But still with the house of Amundeville
          When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,
       I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
     Is that myself, and several now in Seville,
     To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.
     She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.
     Your face—but you have acted on the whole
     His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
     But there was something wanting on the whole—
       Though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;
     As women hate half measures, on the whole,
     Though this was most expedient on the whole,
     Hinting that soul and body on the whole
     Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.
       Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
       Had mitigated part, though not the whole
     Earth, air, stars,—all that springs from the great Whole,
       And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
     Juan's companion was a Romagnole,
     Don Juan sat next 'an l'Espagnole'-
     Proportion'd, as a poplar or a pole,
       Have not exactly ascertain'd the Pole
     So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
     Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,
       With self-love in the centre as their pole!
     Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'
     On Adeline while playing her grand role,
     A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole
     Who measured men as you would do a steeple.
     Like a bob-major from a village steeple.
     And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.
     And infidels, to pull down every steeple,
       Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
       With his superior, in a smile to trample
     To me;—of whom these morals are a sample.
       Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
       Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample
     Your patience further than by this short sample—
       I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
       But still it is so; and with such example
     My Jeffrey held him up as an example
     'T were well if others follow'd my example.
     It is not that I adulate the people:
     The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,
     In the then sovereign of the Russian people,
     At leaving even the most unpleasant people
     For the slave market of Constantinople.
     Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.
     And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,
     Were to be chain'd and lotted out per couple,
     In a grand arch, which once screen'd many an aisle.
     His port lay on the other side o' the isle.
     Make this a sacred part of Albion's isle.
       Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;
     His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
     Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'
       But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,
       The earth has nothing like a she epistle,
     Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle
     Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
       Who in his time had made heroic bustle.
     But when the levee rose, and all was bustle
     And could be very busy without bustle;
       Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?
     Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle
     Also the softer silks were heard to rustle
     So that their bargain sounded like a battle
     To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.
     Like Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.
     I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,
     That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,
     For this superior yoke of human cattle.
     Which is the cud eschew'd by human cattle.
     Just now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle
     As that abominable tittle-tattle,
     The devil may decompose, but never settle:
     Besides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,
     Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.
     Alas! man makes that great which makes him little:
     Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.
     Had made them chaste;—they ravish'd very little.
     What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,
     Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;
     But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,
     And so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;
     I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,
     I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle
     Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,
     A human (what the Italians nickname) 'mule',
     Spain may prove an exception to the rule,
     But to return unto the stricter rule
     Troy owes to Homer what whist owes to Hoyle:
       Others, in that off-hand and dashing style
       Baba retire, which he obey'd in style,
     Depending more upon the historian's style
       On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?
     His classic studies made a little puzzle,
       The evening also waned—and coffee came.
     Katinka ask'd her also whence she came—
     As they were threading on their way, there came
     And down the cliff the island virgin came,
     And every morn his colour freshlier came,
       Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame
       Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,
     The mellow autumn came, and with it came
     And these he call'd on; and, what 's strange, they came
       And to the beauties of a foreign dame,
       And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,
     Not only famous, but of that good fame,
     Caesar himself would be ashamed of fame.
     His fame too,—for he had that kind of fame
       To track our hero on his path of fame:
           'T is something, in the dearth of fame,
       Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,
       Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;
       Those honourable scars which brought him fame;
     A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,
       Of their departure: such is modern fame:
       The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to fame,
     Their energy like life forms all their fame,
     Through fifty victories to shame or fame—
     The situation seems still form'd for fame—
     O, Wellington! (or 'Villainton'—for Fame
     How can you do such things and keep your fame,
       For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
     Of marriage (which might form a painter's fame,
     But Adeline was occupied by fame
       Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the world 's a game;
     For good society is but a game,
     To the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,
     Preserve of bores, who ought to be made game.
       Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game
     The corn is cut, the manor full of game;
     But people's ancestors are history's game;
     That hater of mankind, would be a shame,
     But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,
     Simple, serene, the antipodes of shame,
     No sooner was it bolted, than—Oh shame!
     Nor show your Georgian ignorance—for shame!'
     Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame
           To feel at least a patriot's shame,
     'Methinks,' said he, 'it would be no great shame
       Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,
       But then their own Polygamy 's to blame;
       For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:
     A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,
       Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,
       In the large dark eye's mutual-darted flame;
       Humanity must yield to steel and flame:
       Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;
     Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.
     For health and idleness to passion's flame
       Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,
     While the sun smiled on her with his first flame,
     And what 's still stranger, left behind a name
       Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,
     High barrows, without marble or a name,
     Fighting, devotion, dust,—perhaps a name.
     Without a stomach what were a good name?
     A young unmarried man, with a good name
     Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!
       If ever you indeed deserved the name,
     And ought to go by quite another name.
     But let that pass:—I think I have heard your name
     Lolah demanded the new damsel's name—
     Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name
     France could not even conquer your great name,
     Were things but only call'd by their right name,
       For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,
       Present, Lords A. B. C.'—Earls, dukes, by name
       As music chimes in with a melodrame.
     'T was well, because health in the human frame
       And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,
       It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;
     A picture is the past; even ere its frame
       From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)
       Their docile esquires also did the same,
     Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.
       And in the Danube's waters shone the same—
       Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.
       That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same
       Or near relations, who are much the same.
       Than an advertisement, or much the same;
       And, as he thought, in country much the same—
     Beating or beaten she will laugh the same),
       Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same—
     And Ida in the distance, still the same,
     Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.
       And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;
       From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,
       Of those who have not a license for the same;
       How like they look'd! the expression was the same;
     Whisper'd to his companion:—'t was the same
     Like Holbein's 'Dance of Death'—but 't is the same);—
     In the Nikolaiew regiment?'—'The same.'
     Taking her for a sister; just the same
       (I wish that others would find out the same);
       For I have seen a portion of that same,
       Then underneath, and in the very same
     If she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame
       To make his little wild Asiatic tame,
       Flung here by fate or circumstance, which tame
       If cause should be—a lioness, though tame.
       Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:
     Faults which attract because they are not tame;
     His sober head, majestically tame,
       Perhaps no better than they have treated me
     A kind construction upon them and me:
     'T is true that death awaits both you and me,
       Went raging mad—Lord! how they did blaspheme!
     A fond hallucination, and a theme
       In time to his old tune; he changed the theme,
     Little Aurora deem'd she was the theme
       At present such things, since they are her theme,
     But let me put an end unto my theme:
       The consequence was awful in the extreme;
       'T is Lambro—'t is my father! Kneel with me—
       The stranger stripling may remain with me;
       In mine irregularity of chime,
       As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;
       Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime
       And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:
     Besides, the sad 's a source of the sublime,
       The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;
     The effect on Juan was of course sublime:
     The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
       In figure, she had something of sublime
     As ever yet was any work sublime,
       And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,
     Master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,
       His qualities (with them) into sublime:
     He was what Erin calls, in her sublime
       And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,
     A love of music and of scenes sublime,
     Again through shadows of the night sublime,
     Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime
     Swear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime
       Although they both are born in the same clime;
     That is to say in a meridian clime—
     To the kind reader of our sober clime
     A thing of much less import in that clime—
       Which flashes o'er a waste and icy clime.
       He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,
     Of carnage, like the Nile's sun-sodden slime,
     We all have seen him, in the pantomime,
     A jest at Vice by Virtue 's call'd a crime,
     If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
       Nor turn his very talent to a crime.
       Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime
       But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime
       Of human frailty, folly, also crime,
       Little was heard of criminal or crime;
       Mournful—but mournful of another's crime,
     But here a small delay forms a great crime:
     Engender'd monstrous shapes of every crime.
       And full of promise, as the spring of prime.
       Which may round off an hour upon a time.
     And gain an inch of staircase at a time.
     Its power unconsciously full many a time,—
       All youth—but with an aspect beyond time;
     And revell'd in the fancies of the time,
       A Prince, the prince of princes at the time,
     Was reckon'd a considerable time,
     (The antiquarians who can settle time,
     Also arose about the self-same time,
       (Without the General, who had fallen some time
     Is yet within the unread events of time.
     I also would suggest the fitting time
     All these things will be specified in time,
       The sack and sea had settled all in time,
     But not my fault—I tell them all in time.
       He might—and brought them up with skill, in time
       No common language; and besides, in time
     That casque, which never stoop'd except to Time.
       Milton appealed to the avenger, Time,
       But, after all, there 's neither tune nor time
     Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.
     Again—what is 't? The wind? No, no—this time
     I now mean to be serious;—it is time,
       Though not for want of matter; but 't is time
       Of Londonderry drawling against time,
       A sad, sour, sober beverage—by time
     For I was rather famous in my time,
       Sets up for being a sort of moral me;
     There was a goodly 'soupe a la bonne femme,'
     Or if you don't the fault is not in me,—
     No more—no more—Oh! never more on me
     It palls—at least it did so upon me,
     Whate'er the cause might be, they had become
           But one arise,—we come, we come!'
       Our coming, and look brighter when we come;
     They found on their return the self-same welcome,
     Which made some think, and others know, a hell come.
     To teach him manners for the time to come.
       As wide as if a long speech were to come.
       For you have got that pleasure still to come:
     The calentures of music which o'ercome
     And harder for the heart to overcome,
       And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,
     You leave behind, the next of much you come
     To feel, in friendless palaces, a home
     In Babylon's bravuras—as the home
     But Juan felt, though not approaching home,
     Not long before the most of them go home.
       Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;
       Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home.
     He enter'd in the house no more his home,
       Which overlook'd the white walls of his home,
     To school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,
     For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;
     Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,
     And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.
     Our hero, as a hero, young and handsome,
     And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,
     And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;
     And several strutted, others slept, and some
     There surely will be little doubt with some
     As will environ a conspicuous man. Some
     Is that which I would learn.'—'I served for some
       With love for many, and with fears for some;
     And Dryden's lay made haunted ground to me,

       At least it is a heavy sound to me,
     Catherine, who was the grand epitome

     Your father's son, 'tis quite enough for me.
     And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,
     And that I sing of neither mine nor me,
     And not from any love to you nor me.
       Which might have then occurr'd to you or me.
     As much from mobs as kings—from you as me.
       And I love wisdom more than she loves me;
       And wafted far arose a rich perfume:

       But now reduced, as is a bulky volume

     The expression, and endeavouring to resume
     A moment, and then dropp'd; 'but to resume,

       To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.
     With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,

       Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.

       A busy character in the dull scene,
       As great a scorner of the Nazarene
     Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,
       And serious more than pensive, and serene,
       A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
       Upon the whole his carriage was serene:

       With those who, Pope says, 'greatly daring dine.'
     Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;
     On them and bread 't was oft my luck to dine,
       Small social parties just begun to dine;
     Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.

       On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?
       And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,
     Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,—
     On general topics: poems must confine
     To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,
     Before the sea until it should grow fine,
     My own meaning when I would be very fine;

     The four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;
     Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,
       But if there 's anything in which I shine,
     Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,
          That ancient line, in the "we moonshine
       Our gay Russ Spaniard was ordain'd to shine,
       Was not such as to encourage him to shine;
     I did my very boyish best to shine
           I see their glorious black eyes shine;
     In eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine.
     Of Cantemir, or Knolles, where few shine
     But somehow,—it may seem a schoolboy's whine,
     Regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,
     But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!
           Exists the remnant of a line
     And therefore I shall open with a line
     Then, if she hath not that serene decline
       To irrigate the dryness of decline;
     Radiant and grave—as pitying man's decline;
       With the exception of the second line,
     "The last time was——"—"I pray," said Adeline—
     Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline

     That is the usual method, but not mine—

     And from its context thought she could divine
       Not any of the many could divine,
     For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.
     And then there are such things as love divine,
           And must thy lyre, so long divine,
           It made Anacreon's song divine:
     The first—but what she could not well divine.

       Above them their dessert grew on its vine,
     With viands and sherbets in ice—and wine—
       Learn'd, pious, temperate in love and wine;
     A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine
     With evening came the banquet and the wine;
     The simple olives, best allies of wine,
     The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,
     Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine—

       One glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!
     The Arab lore and poet's song were done,
     The dinner and the soiree too were done,
       Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one

       Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,

       From what some people say 't will be when done:
     No matter what poor souls might be undone.
       The annals of full many a line undone,—
       The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
     By them per hour, and they had all been undone,
     To love again, and be again undone.
       Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.
     Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:
     A line, and leave posterity undone,

       Day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,
     And forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,
     But Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.
     As he look'd down upon his children gone,
       Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,
     Of the good feudal times forever gone,

     Meantime Gulbeyaz, when her king was gone,

       Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:
             Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
       Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;
       Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,
     Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone
       ('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,
       Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.
     It happen'd luckily, the chaste orb shone
       At a long date—till they can get a fresh one—
     Call'd back the stoic to his eyes, which shone
       And through her dear brunette complexion shone
     Aurora Raby, a young star who shone
     The light that through the Gothic windows shone.
       But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
     Leaving my people to proceed alone,
     So much the better!—I may stand alone,
       At length they found mere cannonade alone
       That the young stranger should not lie alone,
     In safety to the waggons, where alone
     They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,
       It might be that her silence sprang alone
       In Guido's famous fresco which alone
     But if Love don't, Cash does, and Cash alone:
     Were vanish'd to be what they call alone—
     A kind of death comes o'er us all alone,
     Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.
       Him up to learn his catechism alone,
       In fact, his manner was his own alone;
           And musing there an hour alone,
     And felt—though done with life—he was alone
       Is first and passionate love—it stands alone,
       Could yet be known unto the fates alone;
       Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,
     The lady and her lover, left alone,
       With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,
     To them but mockeries of the past alone,
     Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,
       That poesy has wreaths for you alone.
       For letting that pure sanctuary alone.
     For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,
     Whether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.
       As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,
       With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.
     As if he had combated with more than one,
     And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,
     It was not envy—Adeline had none;
     Yet there are some, they say, who have had none,
       And Juan, too, in general behind none
     A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
       That she spawns warriors by the score, where none
       Of candles to their saints—but there were none
     Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;
       To school (as God be praised that I have none),
     And so have been forgotten:—I condemn none,
     It was not scorn—which could not light on one
     Some to their several pastimes, or to none,
       He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,
       And need he had of slumber yet, for none
     Which best is to encounter, ghost or none,
     They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,
     However, present remedy was none,
     But of all nature's discrepancies, none
     But there were ample reasons for it, none
     Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one
       And blending every colour into one,
     And then, the mid-day having worn to one,
     The rest—save here and there some richer one,
             The nobler and the manlier one?
       Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one
     Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,
     Whence Melody descends as from a throne.
       Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne
     But would not change my free thoughts for a throne.
       But seats a nation or upsets a throne.
     He had also stood at times behind the throne—
     Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne—
     But these are my addresses from the throne,
       Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,
       Remnant were there of the old world's sole throne.
       But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,
       Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,
       And yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone
       Ever to have seen such; for she was one
       Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one
       Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
     Might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one
       And made a signal to retreat at one.
       In the same quaint, uninterested tone:—
     To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone
     Without knowing why—an overpowering tone,
     He said,—and in the kindest Calmuck tone,—
       The gentle girl and her attendant,—one
     And Juan's mind was in the proper tone
       You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.
       In listening merely to his voice's tone.

     Those gay recesses:—many a precious stone
       (She added in a soft and piteous tone)
       Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,
     Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.
     Men have all these resources, we but one,

       And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,
     He puzzled over what he found a new one,
       Amidst such scenes—though this was quite a new one
       When every year and month sends forth a new one,
     Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
     Perhaps may find it better than a new one)—
       The wild sensation, unto her a new one:
     Your name before, the second is a new one:
     'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;
     Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);
     Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,
     The banqueteers had dropp'd off one by one—
     By night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one
     And then went down the hatchway one by one.
     But those who have ne'er end with only one.
     Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,
     Of which another's bosom is the zone.
       And kept her heart serene within its zone.
     Which I deplore so much; for I have borne
       To your instructor. Juan now was borne,
       After the hardships you 've already borne.
     Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,
     'T was on a summer's day—the sixth of June:—
     The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
       But, come, I 'll set your story to a tune.'
     Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,
     Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,
     Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,
     Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,
       Seeing arrive an aid so opportune

     And when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'
     I care not—'t is a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'
     Are over: Here 's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'
       Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe
     Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
     And doubtless would be foremost on the foe
       And I became a prisoner to the foe.'
     For them in saving such a desperate foe—
     More than the head of the inveterate foe,
       His jest alike in face of friend or foe,
       Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,
       If you have got a former friend for foe;
     Acknowledge aught of dread of death or foe:
     How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.
     How all the nations deem her their worst foe,
     And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.

     And shells and shot of every size and shape.
       A thousand perils in this dubious shape.

     With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,

     Quite a celestial kaleidoscope.
     That on a sudden, when she least had hope,
       But the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope
     Than these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope—
     Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,
       All Calderon and greater part of Lope,

     To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.'
     Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
     But 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'
     That isle is now all desolate and bare,
       But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,
       From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare—
       And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,
       Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;
       Call'd social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:
     Which, with a long minority and care,
     I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
       For reputations he had little care;
       He is, nor whence he came—and little care;
       And I of your young charge will take due care.'
       By the North Pole,—they sought her cause of care,
     An open brow a little mark'd with care:
     The eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,
       Our young lieutenant to the genial care
       What was it made them thus exempt from care?
       And seem'd as if they had no further care;
     It seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,
     'What you may be, I neither know nor care,'
       Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,
       The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care
     For native Spanish she had no great care,
     Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
       Inquiries after them with kindest care:
       More circumstances? vain was every care;
     He may resume his amatory care
       There might arise some pouting petty care
     Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare
       Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.

     How little do we know that which we are!
     Till our own weakness shows us what we are.
       Must I pass over in my bill of fare?
     To hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.'
     The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.
       And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;
       Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,
       So silly as to buy slaves who might share
     That therefore do I previously declare,
       Whereas the other, after all its glare,
       With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:
     Few specimens yet left us can compare
       Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:
     It would not spoil some separate charm to pare.
       Each rose up at his own, and had to spare
       'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'
     So many false long tresses all to spare,

       Even good men like to make the public stare:—
       And others, looking with a stupid stare,
       And all abash'd, too, at the general stare
     Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare

     Of what is call'd eternity, to stare,

     Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!

     Lord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.
       No doubt, in little compass, round or square;

       Saving his soul by cheating in the ware
     To make the nuptial couch a 'Bed of Ware.'
       I mean to show things really as they are,
     And insolence no doubt is what they are
       Undressing is a woe; our robe de chambre
     More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,
     I must not introduce even a spare rib here,

       In the new batteries erected there;

       'T is true, a little troubled here and there,
     Of course these groups were scatter'd here and there,
       Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;
       The rest of all that tribe; with here and there
     She read some French romances here and there,
     Troops of untended horses; here and there
       Following Antonia's motions here and there,
       Despatching single cruisers here and there,
       Unequal in its aspect here and there,
       Months with the Russian army here and there,
     Juan got into the long-boat, and there
     Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there
       Into the best society: and there
       To him it was Elysium to be there;
       Was broken words, they thought a language there,—
     O! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?
           For what is left the poet here?
     I can't complain, whose ancestors are there,
       Whom France and Fortune lately deign'd to waft here,
       As if she pitied her for being there,
       'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'
       He seem'd unconscious of all passing there,
     The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,
       They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there
     And know no more of what is here, than there;—
       As also did Miss Protasoff then there,
     After the manner then in fashion there;
     There cannot be much conversation there.
     But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there
       Discussion, which is neither here nor there:
     May look like what is—neither here nor there,
       But what I say is neither here nor there:
       Direct your questions to my neighbour there;
     Where is the world of eight years past? 'T was there—
     Nor work advanced, nor cover'd way was there,
     None but her own and father's grave is there,

       When exquisitely chisell'd, still lay there,

     Where are the Grenvilles? Turn'd as usual. Where
       Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where
       But small concern about the when, or where,
       Which, taken at the flood, leads—God knows where:
       And Juan took his place, he knew not where,
     Yet, after all, 'twould puzzle to say where
     Waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere

     But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,
       'T were nothing—for her eyes flash'd always fire;
     And led them back into the heaviest fire.
       And gall'd the Russians with a heavy fire,
     A 'dreadful trade,' like his who 'gathers samphire,'
     Thus on they wallow'd in the bloody mire
       Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
     With the same feelings as you 'd coax a vampire.
     This is the literary lower empire,
       Said Baba, 'to be curious; 't will transpire,
     Of a strong human heart, and in a sire.
       For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:
     And firmer faith no ladye—love desire;
       Said Baba; 'but pray do as I desire:

        Who in his lifetime each was deemed a bore.
       To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),
       Of poets and romancers:—You 're a bore,
       They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
       Not only as a sin, but as a bore:
       But since they are, that epoch is a bore:
     Tell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,
     To bear the compliments of many a bore,
     And then they bound him where he fell, and bore
       The discipline of the whole haram bore,
     And then this best and weakest woman bore
       Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,
       There 's little left but to be bored or bore.

             Such as the Doric mothers bore;
       Private, though publicly important, bore
       From which away so fair and fast they bore.
       And pick it up, and bite it to the core;
     For that compression in its burning core;
     Teach them the decencies of good threescore;
       To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,—
     Is 't worthy of your years?—you have threescore—
       Live animals: an old maid of threescore

       Remember, reader! you have had before
     But though I also had reform'd before
     Got to the spirit-room, and stood before
     The way which they had never trod before,

     The boats, as stated, had got off before,
     They tried the pumps again, and though before
     They could not look more rosy than before.
     In search of glory, should look on before,
     To these was added Juan, who, before
       Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before
     I leave you to your conscience as before,
       A prop not quite so certain as before:
       It is the sable friar as before,
     Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,
       The passion which still rages as before—

     His eyes were open, and (as was before

     Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,
       And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.
       But sage Antonia cut him short before
     When Haidee threw herself her boy before;
     But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore
     Certes, but a preventative, and therefore
     That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.

     O'er the irregulars in lust or gore,
     A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.
     The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,
       Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,
     She dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,
       Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore
       And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;
     Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,
       But thus much, and no sneer against the shore
       In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,
       Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,
     Descend—the fault is mine; this fatal shore
     We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.
     The European with the Asian shore
     As common soldiers, or a common—shore,
     But at least I have shunn'd the common shore,
     The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,
       Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:
     Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore
       Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,
       Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;
       A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,
             On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,
             My country? On thy voiceless shore
       Of the pine forest, and the silent shore
     Except mere breath; and since the silent shore
       With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,
       Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:
     There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
       Of common likings, which make some deplore
     Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore
       Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio's lore
     As a volcano holds the lava more
       Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;
     A third's all pallid aspect offer'd more
       Where if men seek her not, and death be more
     I, for my part (one 'modern instance' more,
     But now there came a flash of hope once more;
       Like Samuel from the grave to freeze once more
       And are to be so, at the least, once more.--
       He wish'd that land he never might see more;
     On purpose to believe so much the more.
     With Ismail's storm to soften it the more.
     In the mean time, without proceeding more
       Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;

     A slight repast makes people love much more,
       And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
       This they must bear with and perhaps much more.
       Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.
       An usurer could scarce expect much more—
     He was as independent—ay, much more—
     Never to say a word about them more—
     She vow'd she never would see Juan more,
     The death of friends, and that which slays even more—
       (The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,
     And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
     Thus much she view'd an instant and no more,—
       With just enough of talent and no more,
       'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,
     Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,
     He enter'd in the house—his home no more,
     My days of love are over; me no more
       The allegory) a mere type, no more,
     What! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?
       A comment on the Gospel's 'Sin no more,
     And grieved for those who could return no more.
     We whose minds comprehend all things? No more;
     Tell them that youth once gone returns no more,
             The heroic bosom beats no more!
     'Farewell!' said Juan: 'should we meet no more,
       Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
     'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
     'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
       With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,
       With your confounded fantasies, to more
       The spots which were her realms for evermore;
       Will scarcely find philosophy for more;
     The drying up a single tear has more
       (Not that I have not several merits more,
     Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,
       Except Napoleon, or abused it more:
     Lambro presented, and one instant more
     Hurra! and Allah! and—one moment more,
       Though oft well founded, which confirm'd but more
     Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more
     And yet their present hope was hardly more
       Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:
     Commit—flirtation with the muse of Moore.
     Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
     Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore
     Grateful she was, and yet a little sore—
       Antonia let him—not a little sore
     Replied the other; 'though it grieves me sore;
     Just as I feel the 'Improvvisatore.'
     At least three parts of this great whole), she tore
     And therefore of Circassians had good store,
       Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;
     As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
     There the large olive rains its amber store
       Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,
     Dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.
       When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore
     The court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,
       She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
       Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore
       When he who had the watch sung out and swore,
       And call'd her father's old slaves up, who swore
       The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,
     Why then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore
       For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
       With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore
       In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
     'Whom the gods love die young,' was said of yore,
     Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
     Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore
     More than you scorn the savages of yore,
       More modern buildings and those built of yore,
       Which Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre
     Her very place of birth was but a spectre
       Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,
     A mighty window, hollow in the centre,
       And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre
     Nought against either, and both seem'd secure—
     The fact 's about the same, I am secure;
     Would not alone have made him insecure,
       Don Juan was delighted to secure
     Gold cups of filigree made to secure
       Done, I 'll not quit her till she seems secure
       And matrons who would be no less secure,
     Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure;
     About the day—the era 's more obscure.
       At least her conversation was obscure;
     The regimental surgeon could not cure
       Lord Henry at his table should endure;
     A town which did a famous siege endure,
       Juan replied: 'At least I will endure
       When wroth—while pleased, she was as fine a figure
     Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,
     The more 's the pity, with her face and figure.
     Presents the problem of a double figure.
       And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
       That live gazette, had scatter'd to disfigure,
       And elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;
     Such names at present cut a convict figure,
     Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?
     Possess'd, the ore, of which mere hopes allure
     So animated that it might allure
     And Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,
       Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
       For like a day-dawn she was young and pure,
     With motives the most classical and pure,
       Because 'tis pleasant, so that it be pure,
     'Twas certain that his conduct had been pure,
     He is your only poet;—passion, pure
       Although her mode of speaking was not pure;
       Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;
       Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
     To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,
       Which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;
     Your houris also have a natural pleasure
     There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.
     And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.
     Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;
       To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
       A life which made them happy beyond measure.
     So that all hands were busy beyond measure,
     Before the bridal hours have danced their measure
       And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
       And must have cost his majesty a treasure:
       'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'—a chymic treasure
     In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.
     The secret cavern of this lurking treasure—
       But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,
       Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;
     Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,
     He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure
       Thus Julia said—and thought so, to be sure;
       Were angry—as they well might, to be sure.
       Which are more pure than pleasant to be sure.
       Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
     No less delighted to employ his leisure;
       O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
     Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.
     Or dull repentance hath had dreary leisure
       Dudu was fond of kissing—which I 'm sure
       Quoth Johnson: 'Neither will I quite ensure;
     In case of any premature disclosure;
     I do not mean destruction and exposure,
     'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure
     Upon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;
     A hazy widower turn'd of forty 's sure
     'Fierce loves and faithless wars'—I am not sure
       And Greek—the alphabet—I 'm nearly sure;
     However this may be, 't is pretty sure
       With all the added charm of form and feature,
     With the most regulated charms of feature,
     As warm in heart as feminine in feature.
     Because she did not pin her faith on feature.
       For prejudice it was—against a creature
     Pervaded him—although a generous creature,
     Dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,
     As form a science and a nomenclature
     From out the commonest demands of nature?
     Against proportion—the wild strokes of nature
     Nor judge at first if all be true to nature.
       Since Adeline was liberal by nature;
     We gaze upon a giant for his stature,
     Some women use their tongues—she look'd a lecture,
       On which I have not time just now to lecture.
     The world by experience rather than by lecture,
     I think you 'll find from many a family picture,
     Who 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,
     And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.
     Upon whose back 't is better not to venture.
     And when so, you shall have the overture.
     To them 't is a relief, to us a torture.
     Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,
     Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,
     Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,
     Labour, there 's a sure market for imposture.
     While weeds and ordure rankle round the base.
       Which makes one drunk at once, without the base
       Even with the very ore which makes them base;
     Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,
       Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base
       And pitying sore his mutilated case,
     An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
       Rather by deeds than words, because the case
       In all the circumstances of the case,
       That there had been a lady in the case;
     But with our damsel this was not the case:
       The last indeed 's infallibly the case:
       To gentlemen in any such like case,
     It is a hard although a common case
       Last, yours has lately been a common case.
     They did their best to modify their case,
     Of a young downright beauty in this case.
       Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:
       Juan was told about their curious case;
     As being the best judge of a lady's case.
       On cities, as hath been the present case):
       People should hold their tongues in any case;
       Whether my verse's fame be doom'd to cease
       Where there were fewer houses and more ease;
     Wars, revels, loves—do these bring men more ease
     The art of living in all climes with ease.
       Or of some centuries to take a lease,
     Which doth your true believer so much please:
     To pain, the moment when you cease to please.
     Because—such was his magic power to please—
     Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,
       Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;
     Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please
     Or, if that simple sentence should displease,
       Has shown, I know not why they should displease
       A sad old fellow was he, if you please;
     As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'
     And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
     That any thing he views can greatly please.
       And found their lives were let at a short lease—
     A schooner, or—but it is time to ease
     Still I 'll record a few, if but to increase
     Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,
     The fool will call such mania a disease:—
       I ask'd the doctors after his disease—
     While seated after dinner at his ease,
     She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
       And made them bale without a moment's ease,
     His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,
       Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease;
       The fair Fitz-Fulke seem'd very much at ease;
       Especially when we are ill at ease;
       And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
     Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease
       A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,
       Rife with more horns than hounds—she hath the chase,
       With us there is more law given to the chase,
       To early risers after a long chase,
       Thou art no novice in the headlong chase
       Lord Henry wish'd to raise for a new purchase;
     A 'strange coincidence,' to use a phrase
       The import of this diplomatic phrase,
       Is 'quite refreshing,' in the affected phrase
        Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase
     An orator of such set trash of phrase,
       Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase
     He was 'free to confess' (whence comes this phrase?
       But punn'd it down to this facetious phrase—
       By his despatches couch'd in pithy phrase;
     The topic 's tender, so shall be my phrase—
       Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase
     Like to a lighted alabaster vase;—
     And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;
       At seventy years had phantasies like these,
             We will not think of themes like these!
     But whether all, or each, or none of these
     And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
       Fatal to bishops as to soldiers—these
     By way of sprinkling, scatter'd amongst these,
       Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
     Perhaps we have borrow'd this from the Chinese—
           The tyrant of the Chersonese
     This fellow, being six foot high, could raise
       Of the troops were embark'd, the siege to raise,
     In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;
       New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise
     Flirtation—but decorous; the mere praise
     Is not the certain path to future praise.
       Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,
     If stars and titles could entail long praise,
       You have obtain'd great pensions and much praise:
       He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise—
       Alas! his country show'd no path to praise:
     He would not tread a factious path to praise,
       I can't help putting in my claim to praise—
     In one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise
     But of all verse, what most ensured her praise
       Into all panters for newspaper praise,
     Where still we flutter on for pence or praise.'
     More joy than from all future pride or praise,
       We may presume to criticise or praise;
     And mine 's a bubble, not blown up for praise,
       And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise—
     And not a joke he cut but earn'd its praise,
     That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,
       Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise
       And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.
     Through 'Rows' most modestly call'd 'Paradise,'
     Each was an angel, and earth paradise.
     Debt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;
     Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.
     He shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise
     My tendency is to philosophise
     Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise—
     Here was an honourable compromise,
       But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,
       Her only son with question or surmise:
     A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,
     As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise
       To their own good this warning to despise,
     And love than either; and there would arise
     The longings of the cannibal arise
     Think'st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise
     And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,
     And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.
     (Which saw all western things with small surprise,
     Survey'd him with a kind of calm surprise.
       Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise
     Their own protectors; nor was their surprise
     And yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise.
       But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
       His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;
     So supernatural was her passion's rise;
     Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;
     His youth and features favour'd the disguise,
     Don Juan in his feminine disguise,
     Add what may be call'd marriage in disguise.
       Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;
     Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,
     And if they should discover your disguise,
     Although they could not see through his disguise,
     Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
     And bright eternity without disguise
       The men within the boat, and in this guise
       Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;
       His daughter—had not sent before to advise
     But just remark'd with air sedate and wise,
     When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
     But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?
     But these are foolish things to all the wise,
     To see an old man, rather wild than wise
       And repetition 's tiresome and unwise,—
       Of change; and how should this be otherwise?
     Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise
       But those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise:
     Besides the most sublime of—Heaven knows what else:
       Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else
     The precipice she stood on was immense,
     For they were forced with steering to dispense,
       And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;
       Even at your own imperative expense:
     It was their very spirit—not a sense.
     Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense
       With emphasis, and also with good sense—
     To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.
     Of flatterers, though she deem'd he had more sense
     While those who are not beginners should have sense
     Yet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;
       Dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,
     When Adeline, in all her growing sense
       In the design, and as I have a high sense
       The poor priest was reduced to common sense,
     Or fame, or name, for wit, war, sense, or nonsense,
     His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,
       Grew friends in this or any other sense,
       Your orders, even in their severest sense;
     Love was born with them, in them, so intense,
     Though on all other things with looks intense
     Felt on the whole an interest intense,—
     With his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,
       Although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;—
       (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,
       Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose
     I hate your poets, so read none of those.
     So placed as to impede the fire of those
     Not that there 's not a quantity of those
     Converted foes should scorn to join with those.
     Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those
     Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
     Is lighter far of heart and voice than those
       Yet very fit to 'murder sleep' in those
     And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those
       As if not warn'd sufficiently by those
     The world is full of orphans: firstly, those
       Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose
       Upon all points, no matter what or whose,
     And indications of hysterics, whose
     Or say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose
     There were four Honourable Misters, whose
     This massy portal stood at the wide close
     Resounded 'Allah!' and the clouds which close
       They could not rescue him although so close,
     In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose
     However, the day closed, as days must close;
       Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;
     The next are such as are not doomed to lose
     Johnson said: 'Juan, we 've no time to lose;
       Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:
     So Juan, following honour and his nose,
       And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.
       That—but ask any woman if she'd choose
       And none to be the sacrifice would choose;
     Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
     Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:
       Hoping no very old vizier might choose,
     I never saw such eyes—but hark! now choose
       To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,
       Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,
       A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,
       But not a page of any thing that 's loose,
       And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
     Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.
     This is the age of oddities let loose,
       And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,
     Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,
     And thus they left him to his lone repose:
     We leave this royal couple to repose:
     A loving languor, which is not repose.
     Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,
     Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose
     But first of little Leila we 'll dispose;
     Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,—
       And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose
     With slow and staggering effort he arose,
     And thus upon his elbow he arose,
     The pale contended with the purple rose,
     Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
     Was printed Grove, although his name was Grose.
     And one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose
     In mockery to the enormous gate which rose
     Of eloquence in piety and prose—
     If ever I should condescend to prose,
     Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,
     Man fell with apples, and with apples rose,
       Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
     That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse
       'Tis so sententious, positive, and terse,
     The 'tu' 's too much,—but let it stand,—the verse
       The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;
     I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse
     Make love the main spring of the universe.
       Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
     For none likes more to hear himself converse.'
     'Kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse—
     A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
     Of an improper friendship for her horse
     As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.
     In the last line, which cannot well be worse,
       Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,
     I wish it never led to something worse.
       Yet in these times he might have done much worse:
     So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
     Morals were better, and the fish no worse.
     Which for himself he seem'd to deem no worse
     He 'll answer all for better or for worse,
       Then their relations, who made matters worse.
       I doubt if any now could make it worse
     No scandals made the daily press a curse—
       As after reading Athanasius' curse,
       Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
     To which embarrass'd people have recourse.
       To whom it may be best to have recourse—
     Than any other scrape, a thing of course.
     Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.
     His father's name was Jose—Don, of course,—
     They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,
     Were in the English newspapers, of course.
     Was to sit down again, and cry of course.
     And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'
     The chaste description even of a 'becasse;'
     Which Catherine in a moment of 'ivresse'
     He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,
     That with the addition of a slight pelisse,
       A woman's, true; but then there is a cause
     Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.
       And Juan, who had still refused, because
     This special honour was conferr'd, because
     Why do they call me misanthrope? Because
       As fattest; but he saved himself, because,
     And next she gave her (I say her, because
     And, secondly, I pity not, because
     He died: and most unluckily, because,
       Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause
     So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
     Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,
     Canonization for the self-same cause,
     His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
       Increases, till you shall make common cause:
       And all presaged good fortune to their cause.
     Was long, and thus far there was no great cause
       One should not rail without a decent cause:
       'For this effect defective comes by cause,'-
     In outward show, which is a saving clause)
       And that which chiefly proved his saving clause
       His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,
     And now in this new field, with some applause,
     His little captive gain'd him some applause
     Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,
       There was enthusiasm and much applause,
       But this I must say in my own applause,
     The glorious meed of popular applause,
       With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,
     For, for a while, the furies made a pause.
     Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,
     They hate me, not I them.—and here we 'll pause.
     Which last men like, when they have time to pause
     The third time, after a still longer pause,
       Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,
       The effeminate garb?'—thus, after a short pause,
       (Or rather peoples)—go on without pause!
       Of coxcombry or conquest: no abuse
     As hell—mere mortals who their power abuse—
       The last is apt the former to accuse
     His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
     At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
     Hark! how the roar increases!—no excuse
     You 'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.
     Man 's a strange animal, and makes strange use
     Would pique himself on intellects, whose use
     Named from her mystic office 'l'Eprouveuse,'
     Beseeching she no further would refuse,
       Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:
           Have found the fame your shores refuse;
       He rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse
       For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
       But as subservient to a moral use;
     Whose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;
     Young men should travel, if but to amuse
       But of materials that much shock the Muse—
     A term inexplicable to the Muse.
     So beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.
     I 'd weep,—but mine is not a weeping Muse,
           The Scian and the Teian muse,
     Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
       Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.
       To be the most remote from common use,
       Which doth not shake some very splendid house
       Or step ran sadly through that antique house;
     Though not exactly what 's call'd 'open house.'
     For the first Mrs. Milton left his house.
     But taking him into her father's house
       A supernatural agent—or a mouse,
     But like conveying to the cat the mouse,
     Of plight and promises to be a spouse,
     Was whipt at college—a harsh sire—odd spouse,
     His majesty saluted his fourth spouse
       Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse
     I think I should have made a decent spouse,
     A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.
     Have 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,
     Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
       A topic scandal doth delight to rouse:
     There was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,
       The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,
       The paper was right easy to peruse;
     Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.
       The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
     For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.
       Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,
     Senates and sages have condemn'd its use—
       When freed from bonds (which are of no great use
       For yet they strove, although of no great use:
       Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
       Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse.
     Whose force description only would abate:
     As day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,
     That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.
       Instead of bearing up without debate,
     Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate
     And if in flattering strains I do not predicate,
     What slaves her highness wish'd to indicate,
       Of a soft cheek and aspect delicate;
     My politics as yet are all to educate.
       To put the question with an air sedate,
       Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,
       In health and purse, begin your day to date
       As well as the sublime discovery's date,
     That poets were so from their earliest date,
     As if their last day! of a happy date
     Society itself, which should create
       Not witches, only bitches, who create
     Bob Southey! You're a poet, poet laureate,
     Besides being much averse from such a fate,
       What indigestion is—that inward fate
       Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;
     Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate
     But was in them their nature or their fate:
       What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate
       Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;
       And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
     Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate—
       With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;
     Abroad, such things decide few women's fate—
       A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
     (Since it was not their fault, but only fate,
       And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,
     A daily plague, which in the aggregate
     Old Lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,
       And might have done so by the garden-gate,
       As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,
     And send the sentinel before your gate
       The tenor; these two hated with a hate
       Myself with metaphysics? None can hate
       He hated cruelty, as all men hate
     Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,
     For fear of any error, like the late.
     Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,
     Than lessen it by what I could relate
     And here I must an anecdote relate,
       I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late
     An evolution oft performed of late).
     He had been rather indisposed of late;
     Then ask'd her Grace what news were of the duke of late?
       But whether English dukes grew rare of late,
     He fought, but has not fed so well of late.

     But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,

       A beggar and a queen,' or was (of late
       Contrived to talk about the gods of late,
       His journey, we 've so many tours of late:
     I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
     That large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate
     Lord Henry, who had now discuss'd his chocolate,
       Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
       The only mischief was, it came too late;
     Are masks it often wears, and still too late.
     I think too that I have sate up too late:
       Is used until the truth arrives too late—
     Tell them, though it may be perhaps too late,
       Some wondering 't was so early, some so late.
       A difference between crockery ware and plate,
     I spare you then the furniture and plate.
     I 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate

     The fact for words, and let the French translate
       Ye rigid guts of reapers!' I translate
       And witches unto none, though somewhat late
     The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
     The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
     What with a small diversity of climate,
       In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,
     I could send forth my mandate like a primate
     As fast as ever husband by his mate
     And next they thought upon the master's mate,
       A kind of phantasy proportionate
     May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate
     In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.
     Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,
       The same things change their names at such a rate;
       The company prepared to separate;
     But a mere modern must be moderate—
       Until preferment, coming at a sure rate
     The dying embers dwindle in the grate—
     But sold by the impresario at no high rate.
     And that, proceeding at a very high rate,
     He show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.
     In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,
       Trimm'd either heads or hearts to decorate,
     Through which the spectre seem'd to evaporate.
     'Ye gods, I grow a talker!' Let us prate.
       Now pondering:—it is time we should narrate.
       Now we 'll get o'er the ground at a great rate.
       Of being apt to talk at a great rate;
     But as to women, who can penetrate
       Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.
       A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;
       The last, if late accounts be accurate,
       Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?),
     Meantime the lady and her lover sate
       To ascertain the atmospheric state,
     Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
       A dashing demoiselle of good estate,

       Should still be singed, but slightly let me state)
     Man's very sympathy with their estate
       Between their present and their future state;
       About the present, past, or future state.
       A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:
     (For little things upon my lord's estate
       Between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,
       His glory might half equal his estate.
       Juan being then grown up to man's estate
       A mortgage on Humanity's estate)—
       But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);
     An ivory inlaid table spread with state
       I have always liked you better than I state:
     All that I know is, that the facts I state
       Upon the rest of Europe's social state;
     And so she took the liberty to state,
     Her presence was as lofty as her state;
       At least they think so, to exert their state
     Is when, without regard to 'church or state,'
       A few words of condolence on his state:
     This is in others a factitious state,
     To those who had felt the inconvenient state
     'But after all, what is our present state?
     Might come or go; but Juan could not state
     The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;
     Not all the clamour broke her happy state
       When Congreve's fool could vie with Moliere's bete:
     But all these, save the last, being obsolete,
       My misery can scarce be more complete:
     The two first feelings ran their course complete,
     The Russian batteries were incomplete,
     They trod as upon necks; and to complete
       To spoil his undertaking or complete,
       And when they deem'd its moisture was complete
       Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
     Or gentleman of seventy years complete,
     Their sofa occupied three parts complete
     Which made their new establishment complete;
       Into a comfortable tete-a-tete,
     In souls immortal, shun them tete-a-tete.
       Is better than a humdrum tete-a-tete.
       And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;
     It is. I will not swear that black is white;
     I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,

       Because it might not solace 'ears polite;'

     I 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite
     To keep one creed's a task grown quite
     While others wish'd that she had been so quite.
     A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;
     Was ever everybody yet so quite?
       Would reconcile him to the business quite.'
     I don't mean that they are passionless, but quite
     'Gentlemen farmer'—a race worn out quite,
       First Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;
       Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite—
     And now they were diverted by their suite,
       Were there, with brows that did not much invite
     Without being much more horrible than Dante.
     Her Grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,
       And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'
       So much the present dye, she was remote;
       And of this Baba willingly took note,
       Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,
     With memory excellent to get by rote,
     'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;
     Proud of his learning (just enough to quote),
     Of melancholy merriment, to quote
     Proud of his 'Hear hims!' proud, too, of his vote

     O, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!
     With arguments according to their 'forte;'
     I won't describe; description is my forte,
     A modest hope—but modesty 's my forte,
     And why? because she 's changeable and chaste.
     So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste—
       Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,
       Of light to save the venerably chaste:
       Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)—
       Their friends from foes,—besides such things from haste
     A further proof we should not judge in haste;
     Not that she meant to fix again in haste,
     Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,
     That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,
       Which show'd a want of lanterns, or of taste—
     With buildings in the Oriental taste,
     Aurora—since we are touching upon taste,
     And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste
     Nor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'
       I really, madam, wonder at your taste
     And all by having tact as well as taste.

     You can't repeat nine names from each Gazette.
     Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,
     The very tendon which is most acute
             The hero's harp, the lover's lute,
       Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,
             Their place of birth alone is mute
     The gulf of rock yawns,—you can't gaze a minute
       Two long octaves, pass'd in a little minute;
     Though why I cannot say—at least this minute.
     Because the sea ran higher every minute,
     So the end 's gain'd, what signifies the route?
     All things pursue exactly the same route,

     Worn for a husband,—or some other brute.
     I 'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;
     Which takes so much—to give the devil his due;
     Perhaps even more attention than is due
       This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.
     'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue

     Now it so happen'd, in the catalogue
       And smiling but in secret—cunning rogue!
       And listening to the topics most in vogue;
     Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue
     'T is nonsense to dispute about a hue—
     Clearer than that without, and its wide hue
     But still his state was delicate: the hue
       Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,
     And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,
     Into a gallery, of a sombre hue,
     But still from that sublimer azure hue,
     All ragamuffins differing but in hue,

     Who gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,
       Of velvet panels, each of different hue,
       Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:
       'Tis that I still retain my buff and blue;
     For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,
     Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,
     Lull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue
       On crimson satin, border'd with pale blue;
       From the blue skies derived a double blue,
     She also had a twilight tinge of 'Blue,'
     By measuring 'the intensity of blue:'
     Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;
       Embroider'd delicately o'er with blue,
     An eye 's an eye, and whether black or blue,
     Too wise to look through optics black or blue)—
     And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;
       But almost every other country 's blue,
     Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,
     O! 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,'
       But what 's reality? Who has its clue?
       Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue

     But in his silence there was much to rue,
     To draw the line between the false and true,
     'All this is very fine, and may be true,'
     You hardly will believe such things were true
       But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,
     Were every memory written down all true,

     Doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,
     Of which perhaps the latter is most true.
     Whereas this story 's actually true.
     But here a sort of scene began to ensue:
       Only the common run, who must pursue,
     Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.
     A sun emboss'd in gold, whose rays of tissue,
     The strictest in chronology and virtue
     Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue,
     While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue
     Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
     And such was she, the lady of the cave:

       Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,
     But one which Baba did not like to brave,
     To take him was the point. The truly brave,
     To prove reluctant, and begg'd leave to crave

       Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
     Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;
       As eager to anticipate their grave;
       Or people in a trance into their grave;
           For standing on the Persians' grave,

     Are very silent when they once believe
       Virtuous she was—and had been, I believe;
       Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,
       In fact, there 's nothing makes me so much grieve,

     And heroes are but made for bards to sing,
     Smooth'd even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing
     'Have you no friends?'—'I had—but, by God's blessing,
     I have answer'd all your questions without pressing,
     'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing,
     With youth and health all kisses are 'heaven-kissing.'
     So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,
     Was kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.
     So on I ramble, now and then narrating,
     I shall not be particular in stating
     This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.
     Form'd rather for instructing than delighting,
     I left Don Juan with his horses baiting—
     I therefore do denounce all amorous writing,
     Plain—simple—short, and by no means inviting,
     As if she rather order'd than was granting.
     Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,
     His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
     The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,
     Which many people pass for wits by quoting.
       This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting
       Link'd hand in hand, and dancing; each too having
       So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving
       Had told his son to satisfy his craving
       (The least of which would set ten poets raving);
       The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,
       Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.
       Hush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:
     Of hell-fire—all prepared for people giving
       And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;
     Pleasure or pain to one another living.
       All that it hath of life with us is living;
     At the great end of travel—which is driving.
     The greater is the pleasure in arriving
       Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving
     While she had not one hour to spare from loving.
       That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving
     'T was wonderful how things went on improving,
       With rhyme, but always leant less to improving
     Where every kind of mischief 's daily brewing,
     Before one charm or hope had taken wing.
     And Coleridge too has lately taken wing,
     And since that time it need not cost much showing,
       With a sirocco, for example, blowing,
     Who on a lark, with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),
       And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;
       But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing
       And sulkily the river's ripple 's flowing,
       Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,
       The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,—
       Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,
     So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?
     The earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,
       And fought away with might and main, not knowing
     As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing
     But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
       Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!
     Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,
     As little as the moon stops for the baying
     Dogs, or men!—for I flatter you in saying
     Read, or read not, what I am now essaying
     And thus like to an angel o'er the dying
       Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;
     And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,
     But all his great preparatives for dying
     Its votaries, like innocence relying
     More virgin valour never dreamt of flying
     All tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,
       And round its once warm precincts palely lying
     Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.
     Your wars eternally, besides enjoying
     And still more women, spring from not employing
     Half-pay for life, make mankind worth destroying.
     Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.
     But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,
       A thing to human feelings the most trying,
       A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,
       Reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing,
       Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along—
     Still he forgot not his disguise:—along
     At length they rose, like a white wall along
       And vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;
       Blushing with Bacchant coronals along
     Or to coarse efforts very loud and long,
     For this in silence I have suffer'd long
     We will revive our fortunes before long.
     He won them well, and may he wear them long!
       Why did they not then die?—they had lived too long
     And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.
     (Because this Canto has become too long),
       Unless good company be kept too long;
       So often urged, so loudly and so long:
     The grass upon my grave will grow as long,
     A sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long.
     With her sire's story makes the night less long;
     Of that same tune, when people hum it long)—
     A kind of pride that he should be among
     A dame who kept up discipline among
       For which men vainly decimate the throng,
     A virgin-like and edifying throng,
     To hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng.
     With choral step and voice, the virgin throng.
       His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng
       In such good company as always throng
       The claret light, and the Madeira strong.
     Opposing singly the united strong,
     Apart from the surrounding world, and strong
       Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,
     What even young strangers feel a little strong
     An edifice no less sublime than strong,
     Lucretius' irreligion is too strong,
     Her reason being weak, her passions strong,
     Of ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong.
     But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong
     Redressing injury, revenging wrong,
       Which hate nor envy e'er could tinge with wrong;
       Or the sensation (if that phrase seem wrong),
     'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!
       An awkward inclination to go wrong.
       Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.
     If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong—
       Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;
     His strain display'd some feeling—right or wrong;
     I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
     They smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong
     I 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,
     An echo of a syllable that 's wrong:
       Saith Horace; the great little poet 's wrong;
       'If you are right, then everybody's wrong.'
     I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;
     She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
     Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,
     The cost would be a trifle—an 'old song,'
     And he begun a long low island song
       A thing of impulse and a child of song;
       The red grape in the sunny lands of song,
     But many a Greek maid in a loving song
     But I detest all fiction even in song,
       Without which glory 's but a tavern song—
     And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.
     Their leader sang—and bounded to her song,
     All this must be reserved for further song;
     But if the Sultan has a taste for song,
     Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,
       Is much more to the purpose of his song;
     For speaking out so plainly in his song,
       For beings passionate as Sappho's song;
       Making their summer lives one ceaseless song,
     With all the trophies of triumphant song—
       Or at the least would lengthen out my song:
     Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;
       A most prodigious pippin,—but it hung
       Against the light wherein she dies: he clung
     There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung
     Which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung—
       Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung
     With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung
       Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,
     Then was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung
       Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung
     And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,
       She was the mild reprover of the young,
     When both the teacher and the taught are young,
       That one life saved, especially if young
       Middle-aged ladies even more than young:
       Ye, who have kept your chastity when young,
     In its own strength—most strange in one so young!
     Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,
     If not like Orpheus quite, when Greece was young,
       Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;
     Olden she was—but had been very young;
     No more on this—the dinner-bell hath rung,
       In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.
       Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung
             Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
     Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.
     From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,
     Pillow'd his death-like forehead; then she wrung
             Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
     And grace is said; the grace I should have sung—
     Thus sung, or would, or could, or should have sung,
       With all the praises ever said or sung:
       Or recollect all that was said or sung
       Know little more of love than what is sung
       Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung
     Her beauty also seem'd to form no clog
     And only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'
     And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
     They fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,
     The suit he thought most suitable to each
     I doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.
     Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach
     When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,
     A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,
       And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach
     And all the burning tongues the passions teach
     Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,
     By various joltings of life's hackney coach,
     To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;
     I could say more, but do not choose to encroach
     'Petticoat influence' is a great reproach,
     Through this, and much, and more, is the approach

       Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search
       Farther I shall not follow the research:
     We surely may find something worth research:

       And thought. I say no more—I 've said too much;
     And watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much
     To live with him forever were too much;
     The fact:—I 've heard it—once perhaps too much.
     Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;
     Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,

     All proper men of weapons, as e'er scoff'd high
     Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high—
     The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,
       Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;
     The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.
       And darkness and destruction as on high:
     Chill, and chain'd to cold earth, we lift on high
     From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
     Gasping on deck, because you soar too high,
     Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,
     'T is very true the hill seem'd rather high,
       I know not; but her colour ne'er was high—
       Longings sublime, and aspirations high,
     Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;
     Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high
       That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;
     'T will be because our notion is not high
     Surely the window 's not so very high!'
     When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,
     To attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh
     Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh
       And made thy best interpreter a sigh?
     Not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh
     Said Juan,—swallowing a heart-burning sigh:
       Blushes for those who will not:—but to sigh
     No sound except the echo of his sigh
     Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,
     Short upper lip—sweet lips! that make us sigh
     And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,
     Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,
     And call'd from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,
     And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,
       A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough—
     Their duty was—for they were strong, and though

       Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through

     For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,

     The whole together is what I could wish

       So every one may dress it to his wish,
     Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish

       Of favouritism, but not yet in the blush;

     All tragedies are finish'd by a death,
     A paper kite which flies 'twixt life and death,
     But when they light upon immediate death,

          And 't is held as faith, to their bed of death

     As e'er brought man and woman to the brink

     So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,
     But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,
     There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink
       No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;
       Than what they thought, for mind can never sink,

     The rest had been reform'd, replaced, or sunk,

     Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,
       Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,
     This savour'd of this world; but his hand shook—

     There, couch'd all snugly on his pillow's nook,
       Remain'd unknown within his craggy nook;
       And Haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook
     Or what his consort did: if he could brook
       With the blood running like a little brook
     But such small licences must lovers brook,
       Haidee and Juan their siesta took,
       Paid daily visits to her boy, and took
     True, he was absent, and, 't was rumour'd, took

     Because the tackle of our shatter'd bark

     'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
     Some odd mistakes, too, happen'd in the dark,
       But why?—we leave the reader in the dark—
     With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,

     The greatest danger here was from a shark,

     'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark

     Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.
       As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,
     And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,
     So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,
       Omitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,—
       Of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk
       Were hung with marble icicles, the work
       Pair of scarce decent trowsers—went to work,
       Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;
       And dress'd him, for the present, like a Turk,
     For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.

     The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,
     Half epileptical and half hysterical:—
     I ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I cal
     The truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:
     And therefore will I leave off metaphysical
     But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:
     Her favourite science was the mathematical,
     His lady—mother, mathematical,
     An in-door life is less poetical;
     I quite forget this poem 's merely quizzical,
       Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's cal
     For her return to Virtue—as they cal
     And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
     Dyes with his morning light,—and would conceal
       And more attracts by all it doth conceal—
     All these confirm my statement a good deal,
     Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).
     Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,—
     And therefore what I throw off is ideal—
     Or harden'd; feelings which, perhaps ideal,
     Is but a heightening of the 'beau ideal.'
     I really think; yet Juan's then ordeal
       And howl'd for help as wolves do for a meal—
     So perish every tyrant's robe piece-meal!

     Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real

       'Let there be blood!' says man, and there 's a seal
       A loving letter with a mystic seal,
     With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.
       Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;
       The last war—much the same in Portugal;
     The letter of the prince to the same marshal
     The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,
     Examined by this learned and especial
     And rend'ring general that which is especial.
     His duties warlike, loving or official,
     With nature manners which are artificial,
     Juan, who was a little superficial,
     Then there 's more merit in his self-denial.
     And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
     In size, from overworking the material—
     Because, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;—
     I recommend young ladies to make trial.
     Men are but maggots of some huge Earth's burial.)
       To proper placemen, every Russ credential;

       Of what they deem themselves most consequential,
     To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?
     Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,
     Been one to which a good heart could be partial—
     And then what proper person can be partial
     To which the Levantines are very partial.
     That 's an appropriate simile, that jackal;—
           How answers each bold Bacchanal!
       A special Titian, warranted original,
       To read Don Quixote in the original,
     And so great names are nothing more than nominal,
       He gave the different nations something national;
     As any other notion, and not national);—
     Of Dido's alphabet; and this is rational
       From the high lyric down to the low rational:

     Bright—and as black and burning as a coal;

       For this great conqueror play'd the corporal—
     With which I could not brew a pastoral.
     Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'

     She knew that the best feelings must have victual,
     By tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;
     It would have been more wise to save their victual.

       At such a pertinacious infidel,
     This poem will become a moral model.
     To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
       Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel:
     (Of weariness or scorn), began to feel
     And still they seem resentfully to feel
     Her overpowering presence made you feel
     Torture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.
     Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel
       Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel

     It would not be idolatry to kneel.

     The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel
       My epical pretensions to the laurel:

       The dying man cried, 'Hold! I 've got my gruel!
     Along his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel
     If but to show I 've travell'd; and what 's travel,
     The faculty—who said that he must travel.
       On so uncontrovertible a level,
     But Time, which brings all beings to their level,
     Of absence lay one's old resentments level,
       Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
     While youth's hot wishes in our red veins revel,
     From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:
     Some play the devil, and then write a novel.
     To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.
     Of love! when I forget you, may I fail
       And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.
       And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail
     But for his judgment—never known to fail.
       Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;
     So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.
     Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.
     Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,
     They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,
       But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail
     The Turkish batteries thrash'd them like a flail,
       He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,
       While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,
     Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,
       Than when some squeamish people deem her frail.
     Proving that trite old truth, that life 's as frail
       Of hunting—for the sagest youth is frail;
       Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;
     So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,
       And shiver them to ashes, but to trail
     The stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.
       As there were but two blankets for a sail,
     Here he embark'd, and with a flowing sail
       At sunset they began to take in sail,
       Of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,
     They were all summer: lightning might assail
     Could I do justice to the full detail;
       Being much too gross to see them in detail,
       Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,
       All that a poet drags into detail
     And three dead, whom their strength could not avail
       (So that their efforts should at length prevail)
       At all such auctions knew how to prevail:
     Discuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,
       Which fable places in her breast of wail,
       And as the wind a widow'd nation's wail,
       Over the waste of waters; like a veil,
       Conceal'd her features better than a veil;
     Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
       Array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil.
     Chaste Muse!—well, if you must, you must)—the veil
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke play'd with her veil,
       In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,
     And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
     It is not that I shall not all fulfil
       His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:
     They naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'
       No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:
     But nature teaches more than power can spoil,
       With the free foresters divide no spoil;
       Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.
     The first yet frown'd superbly o'er the soil,
     Moves—female hearts are such a genial soil
       Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;
     'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil
     Life knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,—
       Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,
       (A thing approved as saving time and toil);—
       And cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;
       From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,
     My Juan, whom I left in deadly peril
     The ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until
     But Juan was immovable; until
       Juan retired,—and so will I, until
       Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;
     Unless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)
     For, after all, we cannot call thee devil.
       Her features all the sweetness of the devil,
     And find a deuced balance with the devil.
     Saw Juan's last elopement with the devil.
     When a man's country 's going to the devil.
       (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);
     Man,—and, as we would hope,—perhaps the devil,
     O, Love! thou art the very god of evil,
       The third, the usual Origin of Evil;
     At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
       Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;
       I favor'd none—nay, was almost uncivil?
       His own shall roll before you like a ball!'
     As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.
     Of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.
     But next to dressing for a rout or ball,
     Of what she was, and is, if ye could call
       And blew; another answer'd to the call,
           Hark! rising to the ignoble call—
     She waited until justice could recall
     May sit like that of Nessus, and recall
     Of monitors adapted to recall,
     And life yields nothing further to recall
       (If 't is not vain examples to recall)
     I do not speak profanely, to recall
       Exists—and where? That shall I not recall,
       And was not the best wife, unless we call
     In prose I bend my humble verse) doth call
     The things down, said, 'Incense me, and I call
     If I agree that what is, is; then this I call
     In short, in all things she was fairly what I call
     Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
     While he, despising every sensual call,
     Which it can either pain or evil call,
       To be the first of what we used to call
     There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
     Matron and maids, and those whom you may call
       Smiled scornfully, and said, 'Within my call,
     And that so loudly, that upstarted all
     As 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,
       And arm'd from boot to turban, one and all,
       Were landed in the market, one and all,
     The columns were in movement one and all,
     They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.
     In chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all
       Love, that great opener of the heart and all
     Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all
     The grand arcanum 's not for men to see all;
       And saw into herself each day before all
     Who came at stated moments to invite all
     'But heaven,' as Cassio says, 'is above all—
     Can tender souls relate the rise and fall
            And when aught is to befall
       What farther hath befallen or may befall
     As Baba with his fingers made them fall
     Commands—the intellectual lord of all.
       Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:
     Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,
     Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,
     For she had not even one—the worst of all.
     Titus exclaim'd, 'I 've lost a day!' Of all
     Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.
       And 'farmers' can't raise Ceres from her fall:
     Back to the night wind by the waterfall,
       Worn out with importunity; or fall
     Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
     Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,
     To others' share let 'female errors fall,'
       Had met a party towards the twilight's fall,
           Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
     Besides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall
     From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,
       Though princes the possessor were besieging all.
       The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all
       By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
     Too often in its fury overcoming all
     With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,
     But as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all
       'Twas on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,
       The shadow pass'd away—but where? the hall
       Checkered with all the tracery of the hall.
          Say nought to him as he walks the hall,
     One on the other, throughout the whole hall,
     And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all
            He walks from hall to hall.
     That time has left our fathers of their hall.
     The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,
       To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall
     And if it is impossible, you shall:
     But this poor girl was left in the great hall,
     By night, as do that mercenary pack all,
     And scent the prey their masters would attack all.
     I 'm a philosopher; confound them all!
     Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.
     Over the stones still rattling up Pall Mall,
       Whether their talk was of the kind call'd 'small,'
       Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:
       Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.
     Discuss'd (he hated beer yclept the 'small')
     Juan a moment, as this pair so small
     All difficulties, whether great or small,
       Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,—
       At great assemblies or in parties small,
       Who eats fire gratis (since the pay 's but small);
     But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
       Or 'Ca ira,' according to the fashion all:
     That lady, who should be at home to all.
       Admitted as an aspirant to all
     Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,
       Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;
          He sweeps along in his dusky pall,
       (That make old Europe's journals squeak and gibber all.)
       Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?
     There 's glory again for you, gentle reader! All
       And so they were submitted first to her, all,
       Maintain thou art the best: for after all
     The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.
     And now, that we may furnish with some matter all
       Doubt upon me, confusion over all,
       And ask them how they like to be in thrall?
     Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all
       For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all
     Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,
       To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.
     This chieftain—somehow would not yield at all:
       'T was much that he was understood at all;
     They spoke by signs—that is, not spoke at all;
     I can't say that it puzzles me at all,
       And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,
       I by and by may tell you, if at all:
     She never thought about herself at all.
     A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.
     Of nature's oracle—first love,—that all
       Since lately there have been no rents at all,
     And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;
       My smiles must be sincere or not at all.
     Those who will leave you of no sex at all.
     O'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall.
       I hope he 's young and handsome—is he tall?
     A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all
       I might describe, as I have seen it all,
           What, silent still? and silent all?
     Some hundreds breathed—the rest were silent all!
       Or that the Russian army should repent all:
       Of physics, bodies whether short or tall
     That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;
     Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?
     Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all—
     Since I 've grown moral, still I must accuse you all
       To get at thee not batter down a wall,
     Up in a little creek below a wall
     Of forty thousand who had mann'd the wall,
       The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall
       And caught her falling, and from off the wall
     These Oriental writings on the wall,
     Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall
       It touched no soul nor body, but the wall,
       Had perish'd in the field or by the wall:
     The Dee, the Don, Balgounie's brig's black wall,
     And harmonised by the old choral wall:
       Worn out with battering Ismail's stubborn wall,
     A man' (as Giles says); for though she would widow all
       At anchor under the seraglio wall;
       With more than one profession, gains by all;
       When all around rang like a tocsin bell:
     Sir Walter reign'd before me; Moore and Campbell
     The tocsin of the soul—the dinner-bell.
     The 'little boatman' and his 'Peter Bell'
     Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,
       Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;
       Much as a monk may do within his cell:
     No matter how or why the thing befell,
       What then? I only know it so befell.
     Saw one, whom such an accident befell,
       Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.'
       They thus address'd—and Lambro's visage fell—
     Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,
       And huge tombs worse—mankind, since Adam fell:
     But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,
     Admitted a small party as night fell,—
       Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,
     And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,
     'T is pity 'that such meaning should pave hell.'
     It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:
     So far above the cunning powers of hell,
     And smooth'd the brimstone of that street of hell
     Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell,
     More Muse-like—like to Cytherea's shell.
       Because he mopeth idly in his shell,
       Upon his angry sultanship, pell-mell,
     Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,
     As thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd spell
       Who bound the bar or senate in their spell?
       Proud of himself and her: the world could tell
     His readiness to feel his pulse and tell
     To the next comer; or—as it will tell
       But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell
       In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;
       Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell:
     And even if by chance—and who can tell?
     Though horrible to see yet grand to tell,
       When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:
       Indeed there were not many more to tell;
       His smile, requested one of them to tell
     And like some other things won't do to tell
       True is that which she is about to tell.
     When each house was a fortalice, as tell
     Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;
       Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell
     And even if I knew, I should not tell—
       I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell—
       Was not so necessary; for they tell
     He seem'd to sleep,—for you could scarcely tell
     Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
       Pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell
     You 'd wish yourself where Truth is—in a well.
       The diners of celebrity dined well;
     Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell
       And wedded unto one she had loved well—
       And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?
     By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.
       To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell
     Upon the rest 't is not worth while to dwell,
       Their veil and petticoat—Alas! to dwell
     'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell
       With sloth hath found it difficult to dwell;
       To those who upon land or water dwell;
       Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?
     Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell—
       I wish you a good appetite.'—'Farewell!'
       Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.
     I don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well
     The cause, but Juan said, 'He was quite well.'
     I gazed upon him, for I knew him well;
     Perchance the death of one she loved too well:
       And always used her favourites too well.
     Juan knew several languages—as well
     Even her minutest motions went as well
       Certes it was not body; he was well
     Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well—
       A canto—then their feet and ankles,—well,
       A thorough varmint, and a real swell,
       Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
     There wanted but this requisite to swell
       Your 'fortune' was in a fair way 'to swell
     Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well
     Which says, 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well:
     Of pantomime;—he danced, I say, right well,
       A pretty town, I recollect it well—
     Of their designs, by saying they meant well;
     She sate, but not alone; I know not well
       And said she felt herself extremely well
       And that the medicine answer'd very well;
       That I must say who knew him very well;
     That all within was not so very well,
       I grant you in a church 't is very well:
     Then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,
     A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill
     To draw up in array a single day-bill
       And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),
     Which looks along that vale of good and ill
     But such precipitation may end ill,
     Now, if my Pegasus should not be shod ill,
     Fair Adeline enquired, 'If he were ill?'
     Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.
       The ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! Ill
       (In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill
       The law of all around her; to fulfill
     They were not made in the real world to fill
     Though every wave roll'd menacing to fill,
     What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill
       But when of the first sight you have had your fill,
     Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;
     He stopp'd.—What singular emotions fill
       How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill
     Two blankets stitch'd together, answering ill
     At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,
     Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,
     Arriving at the summit of a hill
     Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
       On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill
     Of the long caravan, which in the chill
     Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.
     Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill—
     Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,
       Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,
       New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;'
       We have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'
     And duly seated on the immortal hill.
     Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;
     Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!
     Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
     Corruption came not in each mind to kill
       Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;
     Without whose epoch my poetic skill
     I knew his father well, and have some skill
     Pick'd out amongst his followers with some skill
     For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
     Or proudlier prancing with mercurial skill
     To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,
     The family physician had great skill,
       For a lieutenant to climb up; but skill
     I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
       And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?
       And all my fancies whirling like a mill;
     And swearing if the infant came to ill
       There 's music in the gushing of a rill;
       Like water-lilies floating down a rill—
     But like two beings born from out a rill,
       Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!
       They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;
     The day before the assault, while upon drill—
       In chief, in proper person deign'd to drill
     His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,
     White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,
     From sire to son to augur good or ill:
          And whether for good, or whether for ill,
     With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill—
     One of whom spoke their tongue—or well or ill,
     According as you take things well or ill;—
       'Not I,' he said, 'have sought this stranger's ill;
       And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?
     As if he wish'd that she should fare less ill
       To swallow flame, and never take it ill:
     Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill—
     It came and went, and flutter'd round them till
       Although she was not evil nor meant ill;
     A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,
       Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,

       His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,

     He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.
       And they must be or seem what they were: still
     What they should laugh at—the mere ague still
     The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still
     I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
     But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
     Night fell: this seem'd a better omen still.
     All these were theirs, for they were children still,
          And expell'd the friars, one friar still
     In pedigrees, by those who wander still
     'I have no more to say, but linger still,
     'Gainst such belief, there 's something stronger still
       While her young herald knelt before her still.
       Great Socrates? And thou, Diviner still,
     Europe has slaves, allies, kings, armies still,
     Provided always your great goodness still
     You're shabby fellows—true—but poets still
     Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still
     But seeing him all cold and silent still,
       Slowly along the room, but silent still,
     She had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;
     'To hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,
     At every jolt—and they were many—still
       And when to hold his tongue, now held it till
     Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,
       Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.

     Left it before he had been treated very ill;

     And now because I feel it growing dull.
       Ridiculous enough, but also dull;
     Into a Russian couplet rather dull
     To lose itself when the old world grows dull,
     And after that serene and somewhat dull

     Without which life would be extremely dull;

     I have seen john half detect himself a fool.-
       (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;
     'Great joy to London now!' says some great fool,
     Had he but been placed at a public school,
     I knew one woman of that purple school,
     Of orphans paints at once a parish school,
     Intrigues, adventures of the common school,
       Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school
       Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:
       With any kind of troublesome control;
       Of calling wholly back its self-control;

     Here taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'
       But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;
     Her next amusement was more fanciful;
     'T is the perception of the beautiful,

       However, the poor jackals are less foul
     Than an enormous room without a soul
     Were odds against a disembodied soul.
            And they seem of a parted soul.
     As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.

       In mail of proof—her purity of soul—
       Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;
       His self-communion with his own high soul,
     Which pretty women—the sweet souls!—call soul.
       A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
       Would be discover'd in the human soul!
     Betraying only now and then her soul

     The ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul

       A spectral resident—whose pallid beam
     Which flow'd on for a moment in the beam
     Upon his senses, and the kindling beam
       Sophia's cupola with golden gleam;
       The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,
     She wonder'd at herself how she could scream—
     The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream
     She promised never more to have a dream,
       And wander'd up and down as in a dream,
     And would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,
       The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,
       Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream
     Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,
     And Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,
       And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream
       So dear is still the memory of that dream;
     To swim or sink—I have had at least my dream.
     And what I write I cast upon the stream,
       They knew not where, being carried by the stream
       To be so being; in a gushing stream
       Sprinkled with palaces; the ocean stream
       Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,
     Or as the stirring of a deep dear stream
     Far flash'd her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,
       Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream,
     A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream
     A most prodigious appetite: the steam
       To think so: for half English as I am
     ''T is strange—the Hebrew noun which means "I am,"
     There also was——the sinner that I am!
       He sometimes thought 't was only their 'Salam,'
       His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam
     Now) you may cross the blue deep and white foam—
       Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!
       Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,
     That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam
     She to dismiss her guards and he his haram,
     A turbot for relief of those who cram,
     A band of children, round a snow-white ram,
       Forth into universal epigram;
       (That royal bird, whose tail 's a diadem),
     The females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,
       (With more beside if Juan had not stopp'd 'em).
       None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
       These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,
       Which is not quite so light as you may deem.
     Another time he might have liked to see 'em,
     I say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,
     As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.
     And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.
     Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,
       That which a portal to their eyes did seem,—
       If any take me for that which I seem:
     O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem
       Great deeds are doing—how shall I relate 'em?
       State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,
       Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,
       Has feelings pure and polish'd as a gem,—
       To see the sultan, rich in many a gem,
     Was such as lies between a flower and gem.
       Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;
       She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem
     Beneath his art. The dame, press'd to disclose them,
     Said—'Lady, I beseech you to suppose them.'
     The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.
       With flashing eyes and weapons: match'd with them,
     Nor would be thus:—the difference in them
       As Venus rose with from the wave, on them
       As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,
       'So much the better,' Juan said, 'for them;
       The heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:
     Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
       And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,
       But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;
       And said there was analogy between 'em;
     'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,—
     Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
     But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.
     Not only in the body but the proem,
     Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,
     Of all his feelings—only he forgot 'em.
     Witness those 'ci-devant jeunes hommes' who stem
       As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;
       Yet if perchance remember'd, still disdain you 'em
     Just now,—but by and by the Truth will show 'em
     You may do right forbidding them to show 'em,
     So good—I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.
     Where every body has some separate aim,
       O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;
       The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim—
     To call men love-begotten or proclaim
       A couplet, or an elegy to claim,
       But let me quit the theme; as such things claim
     The vasty deep,' to whom you may exclaim,
     As all must blend whose part it is to aim
     In russet jacket:—lynx-like is his aim;
       Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,
       At which all modern nations vainly aim;
       Not practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!
     There was deep silence in the chamber: dim
       For his congealing blood, and senses dim;
       And now and then a nightingale) is dim,
       The stars, I own my telescope is dim:
     Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;
       Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,
     But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,
       It was a trying moment that which found him
       Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:
       Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.
       Haustus' (And here the surgeon came and cupp'd him)
     With two transcendent eyes seem'd to look through him.
     But all that power was wasted upon him,
     For Adeline, addressing few words to him,
     That though he look'd one of the seraphim,
     The climate was too cold, they said, for him,
       He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,
     To save a sire who blush'd that he begot him.
       Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,
       Though this might ruin others, it did not him,
     So nobody arrived on shore but him.
     Ovid 's a rake, as half his verses show him,
       And leaving land far out of sight, would skim
     Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,
     My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,
     Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,
       I wish to heaven they would not look so grim;
       Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,
     They should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,
     To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:
       'Sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.
     As for the other two, they could not swim,
     To make us understand each good old maxim,
       And lying on their weariness like balm,
       For on the third day there came on a calm,
       Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,
       Her master and his myrmidons, of whom
     The chief dame of the Oda, upon whom
     These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom
       And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:
     Six Tartars and a drag-chain.'—'To this doom
     ''T is not,' said Juan, 'for my present doom
     When Nero perish'd by the justest doom
     We left our hero, Juan, in the bloom
       Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,
     He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;
       Save a few glean'd from the sepulchral gloom
     And o'er his eye a momentary gloom
       Over a cock'd hat in a crowded room,
       Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,
     To follow him beyond the drawing-room:
     Which well beseem'd the 'Devil's drawing-room,'
     As soon as they re-enter'd their own room,
       Baba led Juan onward room by room
     Don Juan raised his little captive from
     The sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from
       Unto his call, unlike 'the spirits from
     On ready money, or 'a draft on Ransom.'
     And then—they calculated on his ransom.
     Like other slaves of course must pay his ransom,
     But Tom's no more—and so no more of Tom.
     Because deform'd, yet died all game and bottom,
     There was the purest Platonism at bottom
       Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,

     With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,
     One with her flush'd cheek laid on her white arm,
     And half a million for your Sabine farm
       And half retiring from the glowing arm,
       Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,
     So beautiful—its very shape would charm;
     I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm
     Or over-cold annihilates the charm.

     To this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.
     The moon breaks, half unveil'd each further charm,
       But then the situation had its charm,
     O, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm
       And therefore have his volumes done such harm,
     To burn a town which never did them harm.
     Is rather dear!—I 'm sure I mean no harm.
       Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,
     Unless gunpowder should be found to harm
     The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,
     That the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,
     'You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.'
     To scold a little at the false alarm
     They turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,
     While their beloved friends began to arm,
       Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm
       A single laugh demolish'd the right arm
       And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,
     Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;
     (Though less than that of Memnon's statue, warm
     The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,
     The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm
     A sincere woman's breast,—for over-warm
     Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;
     One large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,
     Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,
     Love bears within its breast the very germ
     That violent things more quickly find a term
     And how should the most fierce of all be firm?
       As well as further drain the wither'd form:
     And is there not religion, and reform,
     Suppose him in a handsome uniform,—
     A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.
     And the deep passions flashing through her form
     Others, that some original shape, or form
     But rather skim the earth; while Dudu's form
     Waving, like sails new shiver'd in a storm,
     The struggle to be pilots in a storm?
     Made her a beautiful embodied storm.
     Now Mars, now Momus; and when bent to storm
       His bills in, and however we may storm,
       His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;
       For causes young or old: the canker-worm
       World (be it what you will) that that 's no schism.
       But which I doubt extremely—thou sole prism
       Universe universal egotism,
     Which further to explain would be a truism.
     Of amatory egotism the Tuism,
     Of cities, that boil over with their scum:—
     But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.
     Look like the monsters of a new museum?
       Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum
       Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay world's hum,
     Heard,—and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum
     Make some prefer the circulating medium.
     Their luckier votaries, till old age's tedium
       And as, in the great joy of your millennium,
       Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:
     'Haud ignara loquor;' these are Nugae, 'quarum
     That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum
     And now nought left him but the muffled drum.'
     Prepared for supper with a glass of rum.
     Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.
       To venture a solution: 'Davus sum!'
       And fact is truth, the grand desideratum!
       There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.
     Wakes me next morning with its synonym.
     Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow Street's ban)
       Of the high talents of this new Vauban:
       Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,
       Yet undiscover'd treasure. What I can,
     He show'd himself as kind as mortal can.
     No courtier could, and scarcely woman can
     For how could it go on? Explain who can!
       Which every body does without who can,
     And that 's the cause no doubt why, if we scan
     May have another name for half we scan
     Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan
     And seem to say, 'Resist us if you can'-
     And even the wisest, do the best they can,
       My altars are the mountains and the ocean,
       Wherewith we break our bubbles on the ocean,—
     But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,
     Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.
       Neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,
     Clamour'd in chorus to the roaring ocean.
       Much less experience of dry land than ocean,
       As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,
     Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for ocean.
     But the town ditch below was deep as ocean,
        A half-starved babe, a wreck upon life's ocean,
       With the new Venus of their brilliant ocean:
     A difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'
     Yet she would make full many a Manichean.
     Anacreon only had the soul to tie an
     Stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,
       More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean
       'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?
       Some chaste liaison of the kind—I mean
       By female lips and eyes—that is, I mean,
     Eureka! I have found it! What I mean
       Or if they did so, satisfied to mean
       I have seen a Congress doing all that 's mean—
       'Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean
     Perhaps as wretched if a peasant's quean.
       There wanted but the loss of this to wean
       An uniform to boys is like a fan
       At hand, as one may like to have a fan,
     To offer his young pinion as her fan.
     That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'
     Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began
     A reef between them also now began
     And what they pleased to do with the young khan
     But to our subject: a brave Tartar khan—
     'Stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian
     Juan, as an inveterate patrician,
     Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.
       And also meek as a metaphysician,
     There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,
       The empress was alarm'd, and her physician
     To-morrow, what his Highness's physician
     Angle, the soi-disant mathematician;
     I am not, like Cassio, 'an arithmetician,'
       Convinces all men, even a politician;
       Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,
     Alas! her star must fade like that of Dian:
     Who would not sigh Ai ai Tan Kuuerheian
     But though I am a temperate theologian,
     Are what I found there—but the devil a Phrygian.
     An English lady ask'd of an Italian,
     The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
     And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?
     Herculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?
     (As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.
     Not reckoning him to be a 'base Bezonian'
     For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.
       And here we may remark with the historian,
     Yet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,
     There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,
     And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,
     Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,
     Could back a horse, as despots ride a Russian.
       And drill'd away in the most classic Russian,
     Don Juan grew a very polish'd Russian—
     Between the British cabinet and Russian,
     And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,
     (Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);
     There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,
     He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,
       At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian
     Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,
       Into a scene, and swell the clients' clan
     I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,
     This was an easy matter with a man
     Wedded she was some years, and to a man
       Indeed on any other: as a man
     There was a man, if that he was a man,
     Which makes a dandy while it spoils a man.
       His Grace was an enduring, married man,
     And why? because a little—odd—old man,
     You 're wrong.—He was the mildest manner'd man
     Always a patriot, and sometimes a placeman.
     And reconciled all qualities which grace man,
     And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
     You 've heard of Raucocanti?—I 'm the man;
     He was a cold, good, honourable man,
     Yet Jose was an honourable man,
     Of his drill'd nymphs, but like a gentleman.
     With such true breeding of a gentleman,
     To his Tunis correspondents, save one man
     Neither—but a good, plain, old, temperate man,
     The shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,
     And as the soil is, so the heart of man.
     But doubtless they prefer a fine young man
       Enquired, Who was this very new young man,
     Unto his nearest follower or henchman,
     'Oh Jack! I 'm floor'd by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!'
     There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,
     He gloried in the name of Englishman.
       Are things immortal to immortal man,
     But where he met the individual man,
     The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,
     That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
     (I have forgot the number, and think no man
     'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,
       And don't agree at all with the wise Roman,
       Lady to lady, well as man to man,
     Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,
     Write odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.
       With quiet cruising o'er the ocean woman;
       For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:
     Till thirty, should perceive there 's a plain woman.
     To calculators when they count on woman.
     A quality agreeable to woman,
     My lady's prattle, filter'd through her woman.
       In her own mind, and that 's enough for woman:
     She now determined that a virtuous woman
     Her stature tall—I hate a dumpy woman.
       Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,
     There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,
     There was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;
     A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,
     And such is victory, and such is man!
       The magic of her Grace's talisman,
     From our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,
     Not only in mere talking, but the press. Man
     He from the world had cut off a great man,
       Could recommence to hunt his honest man,
       The dreary 'Fuimus' of all things human,
     For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.
       Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman.
       Are the true lords of Europe. Every loan
     By the advancing Muscovite—the groan
       Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;
     As many guests, or more; before whom groan
     Into the deep without a tear or groan.
     At times would curdle o'er some heavy groan.
       And even the good with inward envy groan,
     Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,
       Which is full soon—though life is but a span.
       Of this enormous city's spreading span,
     For had he not been Hercules, his span
     On whom her reveries celestial ran.
     The holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.
     And if his passions now and then outran
     Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,
     It is not clear that Adeline and Juan
       The coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;
     And now to business.—O my gentle Juan,
     This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan—
     Till what is call'd in Ossian the fifth Juan.
       I think not she was then in love with Juan:
       But of the first, our little friend Don Juan
       I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan—
     So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.
     And now delay the progress of Don Juan,
     So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.
     'Your names?'—'Mine 's Johnson, and my comrade 's Juan;
     This simile enough for Ajax, Juan
     Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;
     Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,
     Stript to his shirt, was come to lead the van.
     Who fought with his five children in the van.
     Not like a ballet-master in the van
       As an amusement after the Divan;
     A goodly spirit for a state divan,
       But deems himself the first in Glory's van.
     Tall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van

     Scott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,
       And being somewhat choleric and sudden,
       Who smooth'd his pillow, as she left the den
     O! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,
       For which see Shakspeare's everblooming garden;—
     He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
       I touch a single leaf where he is warden;—
     To-morrow 'd see us in some other den,
     And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,
       Set to some thousands ('t is the usual burden
     The army, like a lion from his den,
     The restless Titan hiccups in his den.
       Along the rest, contrived to keep this den
       Destruction's jaws into the devil's den;
       What fear you? think you this a lion's den?
       As bold as Daniel in the lion's den,
       About the time and place where he had been:
       On that beloved daughter; she had been
       Would some believe that such a tale had been:
       Ere such a monster's victim I had been!
     Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been
       In fact they can be safe. You should have been
     A charlatan, a coxcomb—and have been,
       As was the case, at least, where I have been;
       Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.
       And worse off than we hitherto have been;
     (Take her at thirty, that is) to have been
       And children still they should have ever been;
       With more of the monastic than has been
     But that in love such idleness has been
     But vaccination certainly has been
     But this is not my maxim: had it been,
       The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen
     There were but two exceptions to this keen
     There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,
       A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
       With orders to the people to careen;
       Some truths are better kept behind a screen,
     And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
     Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen
       And the true Hymen (the first 's but a screen)—
     Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.
     I would not be a tortoise in his screen
     Have half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.
       His garden trees all shadowy and green;
     Which now he found was blue instead of green.
     They felt the freshness of its growing green,
       Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,
       All the attention possible, and seen
       Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;
     'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen
     But this will more peculiarly be seen);
       On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,
       Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,
     The consequence was easily foreseen—
     Also the conference which we have seen
     What opposite discoveries we have seen!
       Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;
       I have seen Joanna Southcote—I have seen—
     The latter worse used of the two we 've seen—
       A nymph and her beloved, all unseen
     Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,
       Aristocratic as was ever seen,
     More fear'd than all the sultans ever seen.
       The only thing of this sort ever seen
     In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,
     And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
     As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen
     Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen
     A lovely female face of seventeen.
       Unconscious, albeit turn'd of quick seventeen,
       In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.
       And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
     Female or male? a schoolboy or a queen?
       A young lieutenant's with a not old queen,
       I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen—
     Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.
     And here the advantage is my own, I ween
     A situation difficult, I ween,
       The cells, too, and refectory, I ween:

       The distant dog-bark; and perceived between

     Hard labour's an indifferent go-between;

     In spite of all remonstrances, and then
     Began to blush up to the eyes, and then

       It is as well to think so, now and then;

     Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,
     The circumstances seem the sport of men.'

       Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,
       I cannot stop to alter words once written,
       I sate next that o'erwhelming son of heaven,
     Whereas, if all be true we hear of heaven
       Had deck'd her out in all the hues of heaven:
       The wind is winged from one point of heaven,
     The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,
     These are beneath the canopy of heaven,
       As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
     Fire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.
     For fear we should suppose us quite in heaven.
       And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,
     It open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven

     Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven
       Of half-past six—perhaps still nearer seven—
     And hell, there must at least be six or seven.
       (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),
     I knew that nought was lasting, but now even

       Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;

       Some exiles from the town, who had been driven
       Is musical—a dying accent driven
     First one or two, then five, six, and a dozen,
       Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,
     Some are soon bagg'd, and some reject three dozen.
     I thought, at setting off, about two dozen
       Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;
     ''T was only the fatigue of last campaign.'
       Nor reign at all, or as a monarch reign;
     And such I mean to make him when I reign.
     Who hold the balance of the world? Who reign
     For those who knew not to resign or reign.
     And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,
       Juan from the apartment: with a sign
     Some have accused me of a strange design
     With this same legend)—'if you but design
     The regularity of my design
     A poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign
     Was bent with grief that Mahomet should resign
     As if 't would to a second spring resign
       Reluctant as all placemen to resign
     Whate'er is to be borne—but not resign
     The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign
     'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign
     Of an old family, some gay Sir john,
     In politics my duty is to show John
       My Leipsic, and my Mount Saint Jean seems Cain:
     This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
     Their Delhis mann'd some boats, and sail'd again,
       And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.
       Mine is the victim, and would be again;
     The death-disgorging rampart once again;
       Such worthies Time will never see again;
     A moment—and all will be life again!
     And there he stood to take, and take again,
       To bid men come, and go, and come again—
       Knew when and how 'to cut and come again,'
     So Cuvier says;—and then shall come again
     Then comes 'the tug of war;'—'t will come again,
     The moment, till too late to come again.
       Now that the Lion 's fall'n, may rise again:
     She had consented to create again
     The praise of persecution; gaze again
       And when he look'd upon his watch again,
     Threw them all down into the ditch again.
     Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again.
     Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.
       And the sad, second moon grows dim again,
       Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,
       In case our lord the king should go to war again,
     The hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,
       Had greater need to nerve themselves again
     Through the huge arch, which soars and sinks again.
       Drew himself up to his full height again,
     Who thus could form a line and fight again;
       A hundred thousand men might fight again
     He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,
       Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again
       Your writers, who must either draw again
     Immediately in others grew again.
     The cargoes he confiscated, and gain
       For they were heated by the hope of gain,
     And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain
       A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain
       Whether the word was death, or but the chain—
     Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,
     The great and gay Koutousow might have lain
     Which gave me some sensations like a villain.
       A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,
     If he must fain sweep o'er the ethereal plain,
       Yet mix'd so slightly, that you can't complain,
     The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
     There 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain
     All these, or any one of these, explain
       Yet such things are, which I can not explain,
     Which they resisted like a sandy plain
     The very model of a chamberlain—
       Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain.
       To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,
     That ever peopled hell with heroes slain,
       As an East Indian sunrise on the main.
     And tried to make a landing on the main;
       And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;
     But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,
       About a liquid glassful will remain;
     Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.
     Where three parts of his column yet remain.
     But worst of all is nausea, or a pain
       'T is wise—'t is well, but not the less a pain;
       And rapture's self will seem almost a pain
     Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain
       It mends their morals, never mind the pain:
       The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
     Who keep the world, both old and new, in pain
     For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain
     His first—perhaps his last—farewell of Spain.
       Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;
     Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?
     If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.
     Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,
       Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
     That had for centuries been known in Spain,
     If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,
       Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,
     With just enough of life to feel its pain,
     When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain
     The tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,
     Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,
     Or if, too classic for his vulgar brain,
     And pour'd upon him and his sons like rain,
     And the same night there fell a shower of rain,
     He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
       Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,
     Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.
       So Arab deserts drink in summer's rain:
       That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!
     But Donna Inez, to divert the train
     From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain
     Others again were ready to maintain,
       From any thing, this epic will contain
     Like to the notions we now entertain
       I used;—I write in haste, and if a stain
     And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,
     Or gloomy Caravaggio's gloomier stain
     Tell me—and be assured, that since you stain
       A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
       The glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,
     That all is dubious which man may attain,
     For woman's face was never form'd in vain
       Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.
     First vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)
       In Juan's case were but employ'd in vain,
     My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.
     Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain
       Who please,—the more because they preach in vain,—
       Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain
     And deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.
     O, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!
     The gallant cavaliers, who fought in vain
     But, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,
       Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
     Into his dying child's mouth—but in vain.
       (It is the country's custom), but in vain;
       To vie with thee would be about as vain
     Enough to make a stripling very vain.
     Could he not beg the loan of Charles's Wain?
     Your heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.
       A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,
     A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin.'
       Were also heard to wonder in the din
       Smoking his pipe quite calmly 'midst the din
     The very cannon, deafen'd by the din,
       That all is settled:—there was little din,
     And therefore all we have related in
     That e'er by precious metal was held in.
     A gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in
     For after years of travel by a bard in
       Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in
       And roar'd out, as he writhed his native mud in,
       May the seraglio do to set his face in,
       His singing I no further trust can place in:
       Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in
       There 's nothing women love to dabble in
       But not by the same door through which came in
     We left our hero and third heroine in
     A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein
     And went down to the grave unborn, wherein
       But the stone bastion still remains, wherein
     Love, who heroically breathes a vein,
       How get out? how the devil got we in?
       And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;
       At least 't was rather early to begin;
     But I am sick of politics. Begin,
       'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'
       Preach to poor rogues? And wherefore not begin
       Accorded with her Moorish origin
       Our kill'd, already piled up to the chin,
       Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin
     She died, but not alone; she held within
     For one without has two or three within.
     Though hymn'd by every harp, unless within
       At some small distance, all he saw within
     Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in
     But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in
       By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in
       The price would speedily repay its worth in
     There solitude, we know, has her full growth in
       There lies the rub—and this they are but weak in.
     Although he listen'd so that the young Greek in
       Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;
       Some said he had been poison'd by Potemkin;
       Which with the blood too readily will claim kin;
     Toward the great city.—Ye who have a spark in
       And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,
     A stranger' dying, with so white a skin.
       Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin
     So that I almost think that the same skin
     Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,
       Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:
     For gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin
       From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,
     The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin
       Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,
       Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin
     Presented a fine mark to throw a shell in.
     While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,
     Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
     As far as in her lay, 'to take him in,
     Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,
     Amongst the paths of being 'taken in,'
     Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.
     After the good example of 'Green Erin,'
     And rated him almost a whipper-in.
     The huntsman's self relented to a grin,
     White, black, or copper—the dead bones will grin.
       The musico is but a crack'd old basin,
       He had no business to commit a sin,
       Of the assault, and all the camp was in
     There 's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,
     Have dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;
       In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);
     Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,
       Your head at harden'd and imperial sin.
       I hope this little question is no sin,
       Than match-making in general: 't is no sin
     My Muses do not care a pinch of rosin
     All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,
       Since 'Mene, Mene, Tekel,' and 'Upharsin,'
       There was small leisure for superfluous sin;
       So much as when we call our old debts in
     When tired of play, he flirted without sin
       Which might have call'd Diana's chorus 'cousin,'
     And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin
     But in the same small minute, every sin
       Praise) if a man's name in a bulletin
     He fell, immortal in a bulletin.
     To their two selves, one whole bright bulletin.
       I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in
     So little do we know what we 're about in
     Will fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.
     Its inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin.
     To render happy; all who joy would win
     But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,
       Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;
     Must share it,—Happiness was born a twin.
     That there are months which nature grows more merry in,—
     Gave him, to lay the devil who looks o'er Lincoln,
       Of English, save their shibboleth, 'God damn!'
       Like Addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,
       And whom for this at last must we condemn?
       They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:
     And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,
       Of heroism, and took his place with solemn
       A little cupola, more neat than solemn,
     As an old temple dwindled to a column.
       Fell in with what was late the second column,
       To the bard's tomb, and not the warrior's column.
       Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn
     Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
       Rattles around me her discordant hymn:
     But Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,
     By thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon!
     Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?
     Who hating hogs, yet wish'd to save their bacon.
       'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'-
       I can't oblige you, reader, to read on;
     The troops, already disembark'd, push'd on
     And there in a kibitka he roll'd on
     But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.
     And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
       And beg his British godship's humble pardon,
     A green field is a sight which makes him pardon
     Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,
     Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'
     In Spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on
     In Germany, the Pegasus he 'd prance on
       Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on
     But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon—
     Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.
       And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;
       Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on
       And pride my feeble:—let us ramble on.
     It changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,
       And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on
       A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:
     But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on
       By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on
       But more or less continue still to tease on,
     If bad, the best way 's certainly to tease on,
     Of the strange thing some women set a value on,
     Is, that I find no spot where man can rest eye on,
       He fear'd his neck to venture such a nag on,
       (His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):
       Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,
       Or pray Medea for a single dragon?
       And Pegasus runs restive in his 'Waggon,'
       But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
       Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on
       Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;
       Entreating you to pause before you dash on;
       And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:
     Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,
     The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,
       All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on
     With which great states such things are apt to push on;
     Because as ages upon ages push on,
     'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,
           The mountains look on Marathon—
     In fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion
       Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.
     I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
     But that they will not do without suspicion,
     Extremely taken with his own religion,
       Into a country where 't is half a fashion,
     Or at least was so ere it grew a fashion.
     The last of these was never much the fashion,
     He found himself extremely in the fashion,
       A wanderer from the British world of fashion,
       Or, what 's still worse, to put you out of fashion,—
       'Tis not his conquests keep his name in fashion,
       Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,
       Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.
     Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
     Nine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,
       And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,
       For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion
     But his just now were spread as is a cushion
     Of pillowing its head on a pincushion,
     Called 'Cavalier servente?'—a Pygmalion
     As terrible as that of Ilion,
     The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.
     Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,
     Shut up—no, not the King, but the Pavilion,
     Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,
     And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?
     Or else 't will cost us all another million.
       And other minds acknowledged my dominion:
       Who did not like at first to lose her minion:
       And wish'd that others held the same opinion;
       Meridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion
       Leaf,' and Imagination droops her pinion,
       And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,
     But none were 'gene:' the great hour of union
     Masters of their own time—or in communion,
       I wish indeed they had not had occasion,
     Even though himself avoided the occasion.
     ('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
       As did the Cynic on some like occasion;
       Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,
       Exertion might be useful on occasion;
       Of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:
     A good deal practised here upon occasion.'
     Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,
     But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,
       Preference, that we must feel upon occasion
     And secondly, must let slip no occasion,
     To public feeling, which on this occasion
       Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
       Moral or physical On this occasion
       Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion
       Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,
       The Russian army upon this occasion,
     It had been an affront on this occasion
       Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,
     Men become wolves on any slight occasion.
     But Adeline had not the least occasion
       Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion
       And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;
       Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
       By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:
     Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,
     If 'tis summ'd up with feminine precision,
       In the mean time, his valet, whose precision
       Save Zoe, who, although with due precision
     As we may ascertain with due precision,
     Instead of hoarding it with due precision.
     No title to point out with due precision
     Let every thing be noted with precision,
     Land batteries, work'd their guns with great precision:
     If they would condescend to circumcision.
       Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)
       And amplify: you lose much by concision,
     Of tyranny of all kinds, my concision
     Will say to this hysteric of a vision.
       But Juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,
     Resulting from the scolding or the vision,
     Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;
     'T was difficult to get out such provision
     And fell all ravenously on their provision,
       Ponder'd upon his visitant or vision,
     But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,
     And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
     Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
       Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;
       As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.
       Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,
     His maxims, which to martial comprehension
     Proved death in battle equal to a pension;—
       (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),
     There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.
     Like virtue; and the absence of pretension
       One half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,
       Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,
     But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,
     And left his widow to her own aversion.
     Writ in a manner which is my aversion.
       (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)
     But heaven must be diverted; its diversion
     Here was no lack of innocent diversion
     Has given a sample from the vasty version
     A drowsy frowzy poem, call'd the 'Excursion.'
     And Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion
     Which serves our thinking people for a passion.
       That in our youth, as dangerous a passion
       Or thrown into a philosophic passion,
       By railing at the unknown and envied passion,
     And if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'
     Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,
     Such pure disinterestedness of passion,
       Nor ever had for abstract fame much passion;
       By commonest ambition, that when passion
     And then flew out into another passion.
       Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risk'd for Passion,
       Fell into that no less imperious passion,
       If souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,—
     Dash into poetry, which is but passion,
       Like other men, too, may have had my passion—
       Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,
     She also had no passion for confession;
       If I have any fault, it is digression—
     Though despots know it not—till the progression
       Which doubles what they think of the transgression:
     But though three bishops told her the transgression,
     And burning blushes, though for no transgression,
       Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression
     'T was strange enough she should retain the impression
       With his debut, which made a strong impression,
     These seals upon her wax made no impression,
     Secure of admiration, its impression
       Retire: but look into your past impression!
     Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
       While I soliloquize beyond expression;
       As the tribunals show through many a session,
       An orator, the latest of the session,
     He saw, however, at the closing session,
       Which put off business to the ensuing session:
       To the Greek kalends of another session.
       To the unknown; a secret prepossession,
     Such was her coldness or her self-possession.
       Upon all legal objects of possession,
     A king in constitutional possession
       What hope remains? Of hope the full possession,
     All these are little preludes to possession,
     Was faint, as of an every-day possession.
     She then resolved to send him on a mission,
     By no means would produce the town's submission,
       As Eldon on a lunatic commission—
     Juan, whose was a delicate commission,
     Away he went then upon his commission,
     The envoy of the secret Russian mission.'
     Too much their modest bard by this omission,
     On which the rest, without more intermission,
     For six hours bore they without intermission
     'T was merely known, that on a secret mission
       Thought daily service was her only mission,
     Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion
     There was just then a kind of a discussion,
     Therefore I would solicit free discussion
     At Keswick, and through still continued fusion
       In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion
       Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;
     Who told him to be damn'd—in his confusion.
     To the performer's diffident confusion.
     You gentlemen, by dint of long seclusion
     To deem, as a most logical conclusion,
       There mails fast flying off like a delusion;
     And why?—because it brings self-approbation;
     'She could not too much give her approbation
       Without our knowledge or our approbation,
     'Sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation
DEDICATION
       By an impartial indemnification
     Morality's prim personification,
     Within the extent of this fortification
     And indigestion's grand multiplication
       And the Pope thunder excommunication,
       Maintain'd with all the due prevarication
       The best of life is but intoxication:
       Of life, and in an honester vocation
       Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation
       Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,
     To virtue proper, or good education.
     Both lawyers and both men of education;
       With persons of no sort of education,
     In fact, he had no singing education,
     Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,
       Of freedom shall complete their education.
     Amongst you, about Leila's education.
     To undertake the orphan's education.
     The great success of Juan's education,
       Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
       For a young gentleman's fit education,
     Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,
     He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.
       While sages write against all procreation,
     Gleams only through the dawn of its creation.
       Of all the modest part of propagation;
     Could stop that worst of vices—propagation.
     And now commenced a strict investigation,
     Stitch'd up in sacks—a mode of navigation
       Your wise men don't know much of navigation;
       Something about the Baltic's navigation,
     Whose names want nothing but—pronunciation.
       Mankind just now seem wrapt in mediation
     Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
     For she felt humbled—and humiliation
       Of a rich foreigner's initiation,
       A sort of treaty or negotiation
     But being the prima donna's near relation,
     I can't say much for friend or yet relation):
       And families, even to the last relation;
       Might here and there occur some violation
       War, pestilence, the despot's desolation,
     Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,
     And, strange to say, they found some consolation
     He had his judge's joke for consolation.
     If I could yield you any consolation,
     'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,
     I say, Don Juan, wrapt in contemplation,
       In that slight startle from his contemplation—
     The mind is lost in mighty contemplation
     But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,
       The landed and the monied speculation?
       Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,
       Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;
       Throughout the season, upon speculation
     Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;
       And why should I not form my speculation,
       And hers were those which can face calculation,
     Or revel in the joys of calculation.
     In short, she was a walking calculation,
       For any sage's creed or calculation)—
       Herself extremely on the inoculation
     With clownish heel, your popular circulation
     Kept the place open for their emulation.
     So first there was a generous emulation,
     I can't tell why, to this dissimulation,—
       To frighten them into capitulation;
     There also were two wits by acclamation,
     At first, then kindling into animation,
     Which judged mankind at their due estimation;
       Irrevocable vow of reformation;
       Yes, I' ll begin a thorough reformation.
     And seriously resolved on reformation.
       Don Juan at his hands, and information
     No very satisfactory information
     New buildings of correctest conformation,
     I comprehend, for without transformation
     But form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.
     As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;
       His spirits, and without more explanation
     I wish he would explain his explanation.
     Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,
     And lost in wonder of so great a nation,
       As when the French, that dissipated nation,
     Than thousands of this new and polish'd nation,
     Of all the customs of this polish'd nation.
       Peace, war, the taxes, and what 's call'd the 'Nation'?
       That noble sight, when really free the nation,
     A man known in the councils of the nation,
       'T was a high place, the highest in the nation
     But pray give back a little to the nation.
     Explaining metaphysics to the nation.
     Whose age, and what was better still, whose nation
       All felt a soft kind of concatenation,
       His vice—for he was of a kindling nation—
       The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,
       Instead of love, that mere hallucination?
       Is of all dreams the first hallucination;
     Upon the foe: the second's ordination
     And money, that most pure imagination,
     Longbow was rich in an imagination
       Her very nod was not an inclination;
     To be call'd up for her examination.
       Was Julia's innocent determination
       When London had a grand illumination,
       Match'd with the Continent's illumination,
       Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:
     That when a culprit came far condemnation,
       Her state (it is the custom of her nation),
     Like other angry ladies of her nation,—
     Marvell'd at merit of another nation;
       The moment of the general consternation,
       For kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation,
     'T would give me pleasure.—Pray, what is your nation?'
     'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,
     Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,
       His station, generation, even his nation,
     But still there is unto a patriot nation,
       Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;
       The hopes of all men, and of every nation;
     A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,
       Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,
     Hate to the world and war with every nation
     Of every depotism in every nation.
       Some mind their household, others dissipation,
       To quit his academic occupation,
     You see here was enough of occupation
     Thrice happy they who have an occupation!
     Is just two minutes for your declaration—
     There was much bustle too, and preparation
       Both in performance and in preparation;
     And here I leave them at their preparation
     But so it was; and every preparation
       Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;
     But always choosing with deliberation,
       And his disguise with due consideration
     In this—for females like exaggeration.
     Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,
       And noble births, nor dread the enumeration—
     The Nestors of the sporting generation,
     Spurr'd her to teach another generation.
       Who favour, malgre Malthus, generation—
     Steel barons, molten the next generation
       Improving still through every generation,
       I feel a mix'd regret and veneration
     Chaste was she, to detraction's desperation,
       Except cold weather and commiseration;
     Gulbeyaz show'd them both commiseration,
     Till old, may undergo adulteration.
     Not quite adultery, but adulteration.
       That half its produce tends to emigration,
       And mien excited general admiration—
     But on the whole, to general admiration
       And therefore worthy of commemoration:
     Yet there were several worth commemoration,
       In chronological commemoration,
       Mere freedoms of the female corporation.
     To answer in a very clear oration.
     Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration
     And throw down old—which he call'd restoration.
     Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,
       But wish'd for a still more detail'd narration
     And cannot tune those discords of narration,
     'Tis time we should return to plain narration,
       This narrative is not meant for narration,
       Who left an only daughter; my narration
       The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,
     There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,
       Was—pardon the pedantic illustration—
     Themselves on innocent tantalisation,
     The inconvenience of civilisation
       Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!
       And, when a strong although a strange sensation
       Partly perhaps because a fresh sensation,
     And now there was a general sensation
     But take an ell—and make a great sensation,
     Was manifested in a great sensation.
       Should ever give her heart the least sensation;
       Grow tired of scientific conversation:
       With fashionable wines and conversation;
     Firstly, they must allure the conversation
       In a most edifying conversation,
     But no one troubled him with conversation.
       Until too late for useful conversation;
       Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;
       By deeming that my Muse's conversation
     'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,
       And mildest, matron-like interpretation,
     After some fascinating hesitation,—
       In a most natural whirl, called 'gravitation;'
       (Thus we translate a general invitation),
     A subject of sublimest exultation—
       And made a loud and pious lamentation;
       (In love or brandy's fervent fermentation)
     With every kindness short of ostentation,
     His subjects by his gracious acceptation)
       Which is for innocence a sad temptation,—
       Should rather face and overcome temptation,
       Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;
     Just now there was no peril of temptation;
       And positively henceforth no temptation
     Exposed him, as was natural, to temptation,
       For leaving Juan to this new temptation;
     Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,
     But yet is merely innocent flirtation,
       A little black upon this new flirtation;
       Seven years (the usual term of transportation)
     He moved some hundred miles off, for a station
     And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.
       I 'm a plain man, and in a single station,
     To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation
       Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station
     This labyrinth of females, and each station
     'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,
     'And here,' he cried, 'is Freedom's chosen station;
       As though they were quite conscious of her station—
       On which it hinges in a higher station;
     Is sometimes good for people in her station
     A higher title, or a loftier station,
     Upon the left, which from its loftier station
       And whether he had occupied their station;
       May drop in without cards, and take their station
     Some nodded to the negro from their station,
     With fair long locks, had also kept their station;
     But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,
     Of him who, in the language of his station,
     Each bevy with the merchant in his station:
       Of any one's attaining to his station,
       So as to make them feel he knew his station
       Or graven stone found in a barrack's station
     Detachment of three columns took its station,
       Extremely tranquil, anchor'd at its station:
       Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;
       Of such a throne as is the proudest station,
       Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station
       A slight glance thrown on men of every station.
     A moment more would hurt your reputation.
     And hate all vice except its reputation.
       Insinuating without insinuation;
       Forms the most difficult in punctuation.
       'T will but precipitate a situation
     Because, as suits their rank and situation,
     Then held that 'high official situation.'
       Theirs being an unnatural situation,
       Of such a sentimental situation?
       Of Juan's merits and his situation,
       Left in a tender moonlight situation,
     About his past or present situation.
     Reflected on his present situation,
       Samaritans in every situation;
     A Greek had raised around this elevation
     Owing to him;—as also her salvation
     Feeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;—
     And no one virtue yet, except starvation,
       One monstrous diamond drew much observation,
     Since he had gain'd at least her observation,
     Glanced from the walls in goodly preservation;
       His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;
     Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.
     At home it might have given her some vexation;
     All save the blacks seem'd jaded with vexation,
     And Juan grew carnation with vexation,
       May be the hoarder's principle of action,
     Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction
       Than the mere plodding through each 'vulgar fraction'?
       What is his own? Go—look at each transaction,
     As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.
     And, after swallowing down a slight refection,
     However doth require some slight refection,
     Dante and Milton, and of both the affection
     Of their exchanging glances of affection.
     She took his lady also in affection,
     'For his own share—he saw but small objection
     Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.
       Quit; and though death had threaten'd an ejection,
     All present life is but an interjection,
     Awaits it, each new meeting or election.
     Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.
     And knew such brightness was but the reflection
       You, my lord duke! is far above reflection:
     He doubted not a few hours of reflection
     Amongst a people famous for reflection,
       Of health but flicker'd with a faint reflection
     Ah!—What should follow slips from my reflection;
     But then the Abbey 's worth the whole collection.
       Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;
     And some of them had lost their recollection,
     The only two that in my recollection
     And that still keeping up the old connection,
     And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,
     Of fault or temper ruin'd the connection
     Tears shed into the grave of the connection
       With modern history has but small connection:
       Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection
     They all alike admired their new connection.
       Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection
     Who like to play the fool with circumspection.
     As à propos of hope or retrospection,
     To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;
       Makes that of multitudes take one direction,
       You need not take them under your direction;
       And sent the doctors in a new direction.
     And science profits by this resurrection—
     Racks, prisons, inquisitions; resurrection
     Would share most probably its resurrection.
       That horrid equinox, that hateful section
     Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.
     But others ponder'd on a new dissection,
     She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,
       Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;
     And cut through such canals of contradiction,
     And that 's one cause she meets with contradiction;
     In some things, mine 's beyond all contradiction
     Is that which passes with least contradiction.
       For what is sometimes called poetic diction,
       Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,
     A corner for herself; and therefore fiction
       Of a true poet to escape from fiction
     Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:
     The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.
     That she must often navigate o'er fiction.
       And recollect the work is only fiction,
     Their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,
       In leaving verse more free from the restriction
       My topic, with of course the due restriction
     Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,
       But very rarely executes its function,
       That all the rest creep in and form a junction,
       Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,—
     The plan at present 's simply in concoction,
       A paradise of hops and high production;
     But man is a carnivorous production,
     Here the twelfth Canto of our introduction
       The absence of that more sublime construction,
     Although his anatomical construction
     You 'll find it of a different construction
     He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
       Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,
       That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion
       Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;
     To some small plan of interest or ambition—
       The theme, half credited the strange tradition;
     Some by experience, others by tradition.
     [The end of the 1857 edition]
       As I have said, upon an expedition;
     Juan was taught from out the best edition,
       Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition
       The real sufferings of their she condition?
       To the surprise of people of condition,
       As Juan was a person of condition,
     Was well received by persons of condition.
     Would fully suit a widow of condition,
     Also a foreigner of high condition,
     For this first fault, and that on no condition
     Both which are limited to no condition.
     Against all women of whate'er condition,
     The worst of all was, that in their condition,
     ''T would greatly tend to better their condition,
       Bull something of the lower world's condition.
     Of the imperial favourite's condition.
     But for a cavalier of his condition
     But in a style becoming his condition.
     And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,
       If I had never proved the soft condition;
     You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:
     Shadows;—but you must be in my condition
       Which threaten'd the whole country with perdition?
     Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.
     Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;
     The fair Sultana err'd from inanition;
       To be pursued as food for inanition),
     Without a word of previous admonition,
       May average on the whole with parturition.
     The pious metals most in requisition
     'If he comes here to take a deposition,
     That all their glory, as a composition,
     And that 's the moral of this composition,
     Lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;
     For all the answer to his proposition
     Were more;—but I was born for opposition.
     And thus I supplicate your supposition,
     I only say suppose this supposition:
       And taciturn Asiatic disposition
       Itself, and show'd a feverish disposition;
       If good, is none the worse for repetition;
       And then there was a general competition,
       To talk of a subscription or petition;
       But for my own peculiar superstition:
       At risk of being quizz'd for superstition.
       They pass'd as such things do, for superstition
     Before you learn to call this superstition.
     Will go much farther than there 's need to mention.
       With other extras, which we need not mention,—
     He lied with such a fervour of intention—
        A theme for pity or some worse emotion;
       Or a singultus—emblems of emotion,
       Or that of any other strong emotion;
     We ponder deeply on each past emotion.
     Of endless torments and perpetual motion.
     We should have found out the 'perpetual motion.'
       The Oda, in a general commotion:
       She put all coronets into commotion:
     When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,
     That turns and turns to give the world a notion
     This circumstance may serve to give a notion
     Had she but been a Christian, I 've a notion
     There is a narrowness in such a notion,
       Pretty were but to give a feeble notion
     But as for Juan, he had no more notion
       (As far as words make rules), our common notion
       But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion
     Of his position I can give no notion:
       All trembling, wondering, without the least notion
       And you shall see who has the properest notion
       Or miniature at least, as is my notion,
     How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
       Selected for discretion and devotion,
       A hecatomb of suitors with devotion,
       In nameless print—that I have no devotion;
     Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,
     But hear that several people take exception
     Here I might enter on a chaste description,
     The world upon the whole is worth the assertion
       Being only injured by his own assertion.
     'Tis poetry, at least by his assertion,
       Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;
     I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,
     But would much rather have a sound digestion
       And eats her parents, albeit the digestion
     And with it all the process of digestion.
       Had been as short in youth as indigestion
     For ever and anon comes Indigestion,
     Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.
       Or, if it were, if also his digestion?
     Dissecting the whole inside of a question,
     'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'
     Our soarings with another sort of question:
       And conscience ask a curious sort of question,
     Your labouring people think beyond all question,
       Not that his manhood could be call'd in question,
       After due search, your faith to any question?
     But then there was a great want of precaution
       In silent horror, and their distribution
     The tones, the feeling, and the execution,
       Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;
     Alone can save the earth from hell's pollution.
     That begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,
       'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,
     If I had not perceived that revolution
     And clime and time, and country and complexion;
     A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.
       Of travellers to mighty Babylon:
     They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,
     But when it was, she had that lurking demon
       Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,
     Fowls 'a la Conde,' slices eke of salmon,
     Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon—
     That is to say, a thought beyond the common
       She deem'd his merits something more than common:
     And that their books have but one style in common—
       A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,
     He also had a quality uncommon
     Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:
     Extremely disagreeable, but common
     This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
       Enough to make for port, ere time shall summon
     Who wake in winter ere the cock can summon
     Bishops, who had not left a single sermon:
       Have taken up to fill the following sermon,
     It seem'd, however, but to open on
     Brave men were living before Agamemnon
       Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,
     And then there was—but why should I go on,
     And then—God knows what next—I can't go on;
     A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon
     And nothing brighter gleam'd through the saloon
     And when he walk'd down into the saloon,
     Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon?
     And saw the sun set opposite the moon.
     'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!'
     As may be won by favour of the moon
     And yet she did not want to reach the moon,
       Who came as if just dropp'd down from the moon,
     Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.
     And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,
       Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon
       A little earlier than the waning moon.
     Than dying tapers—and the peeping moon.
     He sigh'd;—the next resource is the full moon,
     Not only of the age, and year, but moon;
     The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
       That we ourselves—'t was in the honey-moon—
     And thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,
     I canter by the spot each afternoon
       That is, ere midnight—which is London's noon:
     Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;
       She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon
     But tears must stop like all things else; and soon
     Which he perhaps had not discover'd soon,
     With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon
     Man quite as quietly as blows the monsoon
     Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon
     Who lived too long for men, but died too soon
     Who call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
     Your slave brings tidings—he hopes not too soon—
     But Juan was not meant to die so soon.
       And should he have forgotten her so soon?
     Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,
       May the rose call back its true colour soon!
       A man like whom I hope we shan't see many soon;
       His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,
       Fast in his cave, and nothing clash'd upon
     Death laughs at all you weep for:—look upon
     ''T would not become myself to dwell upon
       Within these walls to be broke in upon
     This compliment, which drew all eyes upon
     Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,
       Which gave her dukes the graceless name of 'Biron.'
     A day of gold from out an age of iron
       Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:
     Ah! what is man? what perils still environ
     Who seem'd to have turn'd Haidee into a matron.
     The name and quality of his new patron,
     I have no authority to tell the reason.'
     And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,
       The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
       ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
       Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;
     Also there bin another pious reason
     With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason—
       And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
     No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:
     Which is, that there is scarce a single season
       For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.
     Whereas insisting in or out of season
       Where all is virtue, and the winter season
       Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
       Thee, witch!' or each Medea has her Jason;
     He did not loathe the sire to laud the son,
     The Russians, having built two batteries on
     Or fascinate whome'er they fix'd their eyes on.
       Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;
       With 'sauces Genevoises,' and haunch of venison;
     It was as if their little looks could poison
     Having wound up with this sublime comparison,
     I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,
       Of any modern female saint's comparison;
     And, as my friend Scott says, 'I sound my warison;'
     So far relax'd her thoughts from their sweet prison,
     Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.
       Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;
       As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:
     In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;
     By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,
       Heaven help me! I 'm but little of a parson:
     Such things a mother had not known her son
       Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?
       Man's pity 's for himself, or for his son,
     But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,
     They generally have some only son,
     Until it centred in an only son,
       How our villeggiatura will get on.
       Of highest caste—the Brahmins of the ton.
     Death laughs—Go ponder o'er the skeleton
       Not so Leonidas and Washington,
       That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:
     However this might be, the race went on
     Nothing.—The work of glory still went on
       He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on
     The insults, too, of every servile glutton,
       Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;
     Who all the time was eating up his mutton.
       For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;
     Some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on
       A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:
       And without word, a sign her finger drew on
     Is neither man nor woman.' The chief threw on
       He never would believe the city won
       Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:
       Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,
     First partings form a lesson hard to learn,
     Rejected several suitors, just to learn
     Which some are born with, but the most part learn
       So that civilisation they may learn;
     He must his laurels separately earn;
     With such small gear to give myself concern:
     But here I leave the general concern,
     'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
     Yet grew a little pale—with what? concern?
     To Jack howe'er this gave but slight concern:
     There is a sort of unexprest concern,
     But this is not at present my concern,
     In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern
     And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.
     And when they grew so—on their new-found lantern,
     Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,
       Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,
     Her aspect was as usual, still—not stern—
     My natural temper 's really aught but stern,
     Made up upon an amatory pattern,
     Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
     Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.

     The festal midnight, and the levee morn.

     As passion rises, with its bosom worn,
     Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,
       Without resistance, see their city burn.
       Of your own footsteps—voices from the urn
     The odds are that he finds a handsome urn
     Unto that rather somewhat misty bourn,
          When an heir is born, he 's heard to mourn,
       Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:
       Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn
     Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,
     I think I know a trick or two, would turn
     But Johnson only ran off, to return
     An honest gentleman at his return
       Perhaps it may set out on its return,—
     Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.
     But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,
     Though all deserving equally to turn
       But could not eat them, being in his turn
     How to accept a better in his turn.
       'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,

     The umbrage of the wood so cool and dun

     Return we to Don Juan. He begun
     But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.
       And more robust of figure,—then begun
     Alfonso paused a minute—then begun
     The man was well nigh dead, ere men begun
       Were served out to the people, who begun

       On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.
     There was a goodly match too, to be run
     He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,
       Frederic the Great from Molwitz deign'd to run,
       Her person if allow'd at large to run,
       Of the continuance of the gale: to run
     How earth could round the solar orbit run,
       But now I can't tell where it may not run.
       But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.
     They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,

       Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The sun
       Haidee was Passion's child, born where the sun
       Light to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun
       Flow'd like an Alpine torrent which the sun
     She waited on her lady with the sun,
     He saw his white walls shining in the sun,
     Dancing all free and happy in the sun),
     Especially in countries near the sun:
       Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun
     Some feelings, universal as the sun,
     Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,
     The seventh day, and no wind—the burning sun
       And follow far the disappearing sun,
       To critics, or to hail the setting sun
     That hides the past world, like to a set sun
       Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
       And all the fault of that indecent sun,

     The cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell down
     Who threaten'd death—so Juan knock'd him down.
       And redly ran his blushing waters down.

       As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.
       And then as an improvement 't will be shown:

       That they bred in and in, as might be shown,

     Exactly why it was before him thrown,
     I can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown
       For fifty tons of water were upthrown
     One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,

       In short, I must not lead the life I did do;

       Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who
       Can give us either pain or pleasure, who

       Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who
     At length one whisper'd his companion, who

     Which he divided with Pedrillo, who

       By theories quite practicable too;

       And round them ran a yellow border too;
     Devour'd it, longing for the other too.
       Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,

     To do with the transactions of my hero,
     But I will fall at least as fell my hero;
     But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero
     He glanced like a personified Bolero;
     But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,
     But though your years as man tend fast to zero,
     Sure my invention must be down at zero,
     'La Belle Alliance' of dunces down at zero,
     That sons should not be educated so.

       As better knowing why they should be so,
     'T is not their fault, nor mine, if this be so—
       At least to follow those who might be so.'
     Farther—it might or might not be so.

     I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.

     How dare you think your lady would go on so?
     She who for many years had watch'd her son so—
     I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,
       Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;
     And then you overstrain yourself, or so,
     Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,

     And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.
     Trouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so
       O, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)—
       And honour'd, ran a risk of growing less so;
       When once decanted;—I presume to guess so,
     But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;
     That anybody should disturb you so;
     Is that portentous phrase, 'I told you so,'
       In their resolves—alas! that I should say so!
       And long besides.'—'Oh! if 't is really so,

     But sometimes stumbling over a potato,—
     The third is still more difficult to stand to;

       Those became one who soon were to be two,
     One or the other, but which of the two
       Which prove plain English truer of the two.
       Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,
     Must the event decide between the two?
     For there were but three shirts between the two;
     The sacraments have been reduced to two
     (In copying) this long canto into two;
       Another gentle common-place or two,
       We will omit the proofs, save one or two:

     I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap—
     In female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.
       My similes are gather'd in a heap,
     Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,
     Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,
     Since—since—in youth, I had the sad mishap—
     I have seen the Landholders without a rap—
       Advances with exasperated rap,
     There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,
     The House of Commons turn'd to a tax-trap—
       Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:
       Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,
     Admiring this new native of the deep.
     Away the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.
       Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep
       At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
     A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,
     Through the serene and placid glassy deep,
     Who look'd a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:
     And if we can but till the morning keep
     As if to ask how you can dare to keep
     A vigil there, where all but death should sleep.
     Now pillow'd cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,
     Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,
       Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:
     Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep
     And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.
     Which fain would lull its river-child to sleep.
     Also the honourable Mrs. Sleep,
     Our counsel—(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'
       A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,
       Lay in a breathless, hush'd, and stony sleep;
     When first she starts, and then returns to peep,
     Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;
       'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
           Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,
       Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,
       Itself to apathy, for we must steep
     Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
       Our least of sorrows are such as we weep;
     And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.
       'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,
     Death, so call'd, is a thing which makes men weep,
     Lovely seem'd any object that should sweep
       By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;
           May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;
     The lands on either side are his; the ship
     The story scarcely pass'd a single lip—
     And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;
     If now and then there happen'd a slight slip,
     From which the secret nobody could rip:
     For him the fragrant produce of each trip;
     I won't describe,—that is, if I can help
     If I can stave off thought, which—as a whelp
     Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp
     But to the tale:—great joy unto the camp!
     Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,
     O'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,
     Yes! ready money is Aladdin's lamp.
     Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp:—
       To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop
     They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,
     But for the destiny of this young troop,
     Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
     How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,
       A female child of ten years tried to stoop
     Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop
     And said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop
     For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'
     If that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop—
     A quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'
     For then they are very difficult to stop.
       At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:
     And then a slave bethought her of a harp;
       But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,
     At the first notes, irregular and sharp,
       And make a music, whether flat or sharp.
     Then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp
       Yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp
       His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,
       In vain she struggled in her father's grasp—
       Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,
       She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
       Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,
     His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup
     Her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up—
     Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!
       Thousands of slaughter'd men, a yet warm group
     As renegadoes; while in hapless group,
     Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,
     Will wonder where such animals could sup!
     And then—and then—and then—sit down and sup.
     A tear or two, and then we make it up;
       No less a victim to the bolt and bar.
       Who limits all his battles to the bar
       Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar
       Have such a prescience, it should be no bar
     And epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;
     When for a passport, or some other bar
       Yet inexperience could not be his bar
     It laughs not—there is now no fleshy bar
       That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.
       Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar
     Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?
     In fact, the only Christian she could bear
       They live upon the love of life, and bear
       Or solitary, as they chose to bear
       And never having dreamt what 't was to bear
     Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,
     A moment more will bring the sight to bear
       If once their phantasies be brought to bear
       And (though I could not now and then forbear
     Above all, I beg all men to forbear
     And all (except Mahometans) forbear
     The cause of this odd travesty?'—'Forbear,'
     Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;
       You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear
       As the last link with all she had held dear;
       A lover with caprices soft and dear,
       But what they please; and if that things be dear,
       He strips from man that mantle (far more dear
     And deem'd that fallen worship far more dear
       Whate'er our household gods protect of dear,
     Out of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,
       A pleasure—like all pleasures—rather dear;
     To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.
     A country in all senses the most dear
       Of deeds to human happiness most dear,
     Defended at a price extremely dear.
     I 'm puzzled what to do with you, my dear,'
     Some millions must be wrong, that 's pretty dear;
     Of deeds and days when they had fill'd the ear
     It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,
     Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,
     And shriek for water into a deaf ear,—
     And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear
       Began, as is the consequence of fear,
       Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,
       And there 's a courage which grows out of fear,
     Elsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,
       While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,
       Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,
       So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,
     We 'll talk of that anon.—'T is sweet to hear
     But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
       By Homer's 'Catalogue of ships' is clear;
       Traps for the traveller; every highway 's clear:
     Though sometimes faintly flush'd—and always clear,
     Extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.
       So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,
       Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,
     To poor Katinka: 'Spain 's an island near
     (Come, sir, get in)—my master must be near:
     She had some other motive much more near
     Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,—
     And no more handy substitute been near.
       And lay before them with his children near,
     A gentlemanly distance, not too near,
     To cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near
       To be fill'd up by spade or mattock's near,
     But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,
       A slender streak of blood announced how near
       Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,
       And yet was what you are: from ear to ear
     'T is time that some new prophet should appear,
     'Ay,' quoth his friend, 'I thought it would appear
     'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
       Which makes the southern autumn's day appear
       You look down o'er the precipice, and drear
       The season, rather than to winter drear,
       Some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,
       The worst to know it:—when the mountains rear
     From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
     Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.
           For Greeks a blush—for Greece a tear.
       The sort of sound we echo with a tear,
     A lover as had cost her many a tear,
       And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
     Of age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;—
       Were melted for a moment: though no tear
     And these are things which ask a tender tear,
     Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.
     'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear—
     Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,
       Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.
       The sea-coal fires the 'earliest of the year;'
       Just at the close of the first bridal year,
       Find one, each day of the delightful year;
     Who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.
       I mean, that every age and every year,
     Of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar

     Because 't is liquor only, and being far
     Being pride, which leads the mind to soar too far,
     Reader! I have kept my word,—at least so far
       But by degrees, that they were fairer far
     But still he smiles; and whether near or far,
     The ways that lead there, be they near or far,
       Upon the captive, freedom? He 's as far
     Or three, or two, or one, send very far!
     To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.
     There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
     'Why Fame—but Fame you know 's sometimes a liar—
     'Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?

       In the same moment, loud as even the roar
     The ocean of eternity: the roar
       Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar
     The death-cry drowning in the battle's roar.
     And midnight listens to the lion's roar,
     Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,
       And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,
     Save thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!
     His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
     The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,
       Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.

     We know, too, they very fond of war,

       The nights and days most people can remember
     Ere patriots their true country can remember;—
     But there 's no shooting (save grouse) till September.
     Variety itself will more encumber.
     Not finding that the additions much encumber.
       By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:
       Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber
     Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;—
       Nor did she find the quantity encumber,
     And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,
       And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
     A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;
       Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;
     By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber
       Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:—
       One wonder'd what to do with such a number
     But as 'there 's safety' grafted in the number
     She then prefers him in the plural number,
     And therefore we must give the greater number
       With torches, friends, and servants in great number;
       And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number
     And then there 's the Grotesca—such a dancer!

       A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,

       A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder—

     And when I think upon a pot of beer—
       Having no equals, nothing which had e'er
     Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,
     Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,
       Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,
       Without the least propensity to jeer:
       Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er
       Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.
       Secundum artem: but although we sneer

       Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er
     Now here we should distinguish; for howe'er
     So were the Cretans—from which I infer

     O, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,
       Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,
       For Europe ploughs in Afric like 'bos piger:'
     And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger
     In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,
       'T is also subject to the double danger

       Talk about poetry, and 'rack and manger,'
       Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
       Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,
     Her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,
       For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,
     What a strange thing is man? and what a stranger
       Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:
     He would have hospitably cured the stranger,
       The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,
     For soon or late Love is his own avenger.
       For if he don't, I doubt if men will longer—
     This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer
     Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.
       The people by and by will be the stronger:
     It pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer
     They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher
     Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,
     So beautiful that art could little mend her,
     And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,
     Fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,
     Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her.
     But none of these possess'd a sting to wound her—
     Retired; and, as went out, calmly kiss'd her,
     Ah! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!
       Where Geography finds no one to oblige her
     Or widow, maid or mother, she can change her
       Who wish'd they had a brother just like her,
     Some thought her dress did not so much become her,
     When nature wears the gown that doth become her,
     And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
       As cavalier servente, or despise her;
     His country's wrongs and his despair to save her
     Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her
     As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:
     He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,
       And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
     A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher
       Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;
       So much into the raw as quite to wrong her
     Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,
       Valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:
     If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,
     'No, faith.'—'What then?'—'I ran away from her.'
       On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:
     Or madam dies.'—Alfonso mutter'd, 'D—n her,'
     Of carnage,—and I think he was more glad in her
       Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);
       Had more of her existence, for in her
     Thus lived—thus died she; never more on her
     Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:
       For a return to hatred: I would shun her
       Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.
     That beef and battles both were owing to her.
     But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.
     Experience is the chief philosopher,
     In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
     So much did Juan's setting off distress her,
     Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,
       Are things the turning of a hair or feather
     These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
     Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?

     And also of his mother, if you 'd rather.
     To name a thing in nomenclature rather
     Beyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,—but would much rather
     Of food I think with Philip's son, or rather
     Dependent on the public altogether;
     A little spoil'd, but not so altogether;
     He caged in one huge hamper altogether.
       Or got rid of the parties altogether,
     Instead of standing staring all together,
     He might be taught, by love and her together—
       Is not to be put hastily together;
     However strange, he could not yet forget her,
       For the imperial presence, wherein whether
     This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
       (Whatever people say), I don't know whether
     So many troubles from her birth beset her,
     They ran the boat for shore,—and overset her.
     And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,
     Had left all the accomplishments she taught her
     I really don't know what, nor Julia either.
     And break a promise after having made it her,
     It were much better to have both than neither.
     And then decide, without great wrong to either,
     Like garden gods—and not so decent either.
     And how he had been toss'd, he scarce knew whither:
       But harrow up his feelings till they wither,
       And such are many—though I only meant her
     For half his days were pass'd at church, the other
     Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,
     Juan and Haidee gazed upon each other
     Free as a married woman, or such other
       Clash'd 'gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother
     Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.
     Perhaps you 'll have a letter from the mother,
     Revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,
       His manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;
     Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,
       Or whether they were 'maids' who call'd her mother;
     Show off—to please their company or mother.
       And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,
       And next day paid a visit to his mother,
     'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
     Is more than I know—But Don Juan's mother
       Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother
       In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother
       Her office was to keep aloof or smother
     And to contend with thoughts she could not smother

       Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;
     Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.
       The happiest mortals even after dinner—

       Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,
       Had gather'd a large tear into its corner,
       Where he may fix himself like small 'Jack Horner,'
       For she was not a sentimental mourner
       The friend of artists, if not arts,—the owner,

     The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
     The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er

       And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er
     But 'en avant!' The light loves languish o'er
       Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;
       But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
     Instead of heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er
       Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,
       Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
     The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,

     In decent London when the daylight 's o'er;
       With thick'ning canopy the conflict o'er,
       The exact affair on which he was sent o'er.
     There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,
       And my internal spirit cut a caper:
     This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
       The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):
       In taking up this paltry sheet of paper,
     But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.
       A certain portion of uncertain paper:
     I 'm serious—so are all men upon paper;
     O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,
     Their office; he took up an old newspaper;
       Are bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,
     Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
     And hold up to the sun my little taper?
     All there was as he left it: still his taper
       And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'
     The endless soot bestows a tint far deeper
     Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,
     A legal broom 's a moral chimney-sweeper,
     Changeable too, yet somehow idem semper;
     Temperate I am, yet never had a temper;
     Cheerful, but sometimes rather apt to whimper;
     From Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,
     Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,
     Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper
     Which sits for ever upon memory's crupper,
     But, if you can contrive, get next at supper;
     O, ye ambrosial moments! always upper
     The whole court melted into one wide whisper,
     But thinks less of good eating than the whisper

     The elder ladies' wrinkles curl'd much crisper
     But county contests cost him rather dearer,
     In short, there never was a better hearer.
     He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;—
     Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,
       Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;
     Or do they benefit mankind? Lean miser!
       May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,
     Let spendthrifts' heirs enquire of yours—who 's wiser?
     And the Lord Henry was a great debater,
     And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater
       Right honestly, 'he liked an honest hater!'-
     So that few members kept the house up later.

     Embarrass'd somewhat both with fire and water.
       Till skimm'd—and then there was some milk and water,
     The day before, fast sleeping on the water,
     Of an old man who lived upon the water.
     Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,
     The old hen by running headlong to the water.
     Count Damas drove them back into the water
     Where blood was talk'd of as we would of water;
       (Antonia! let me have a glass of water).
       And gather'd as they run like growing water
       Sounding like very supernatural water,
       After long travelling by land or water,
     In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.
       But of the portion which attack'd by water,
     The third, in columns two, attack'd by water.
       She show'd a great dislike to holy water:
     Juan knew nought of such a character—
     Adeline, no deep judge of character,
       And with that gentle, serious character,
     Now whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,
     With 'schnapps'—sad dogs! whom 'Hundsfot,' or 'Verflucter,'
       Which now-a-days is the thermometer
       For parliament is our barometer:
     But it is time that I should hoist my 'blue Peter,'
       Found in one sigh the best interpreter
       Honour was more before their names than after;
     Sermons and soda-water the day after.
     A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,
       Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,
     And frights, especially if 'tis a daughter,
     Safe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter
       'Carnage' (so Wordsworth tells you) 'is God's daughter:'
       They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
       That usual paragon, an only daughter,
     Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter
     Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,
     A most unoriental roar of laughter.
       Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;
     Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,
     But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,
     For glory gaping o'er a sea of slaughter:
     Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.
     Pell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.
       Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,
     After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,
       At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
       But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,
       In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter
     I have seen Napoleon, who seem'd quite a Jupiter,
     Through which the deepen'd glories once could enter,
       On which the Muse has always sought to enter.
     Now yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,
     And they had wasted now almost a quarter.
       Among the foremost, offer'd him good quarter,
     Who make the beds of those who won't take quarter
     His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)
     Do pray undo the bolt a little faster—
     Dine with them on his pastor and his master.
     'For God's sake, Madam—Madam—here 's my master,
     Even in extremity of their disaster,
     Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!
     As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.
     That they as easily might do the youngster,
       Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:
       It was his foible, but by no means sinister—
     His bosom,—for he never had a sister:
     Less like a young wife than an aged sister.
     They say his system 't is in vain to batter,
       I sing them both, and am about to batter
       Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,
     And yet who can believe it? I would shatter
       Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,
     'T is also of some moment to the latter:
       And Juan too, especially the latter.
       The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,
     O'er silenced cities, merely served to flatter
       Just as a languid smile began to flatter
     The former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;
       But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);
     He being paid to satirize or flatter,
       In any thing, however she might flatter
       But words are not enough in such a matter,
     He was a bachelor, which is a matter
     As the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'
       Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;—
       Anticipating aught about the matter:
     And work away like spirit upon matter,
     When Bishop Berkeley said 'there was no matter,'
       If this be the right reading—'t is no matter;
       Perhaps she had nothing to confess:—no matter,
     How far it profits is another matter.-
       For immaterialism 's a serious matter;
       A female family 's a serious matter
     Proved even still a more nutritious matter,
       Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:
       Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?
     Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,
     Thus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better
     When he allured poor Dolon:—you had better
     All this were very well, and can't be better;
     Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better
     The Druids' groves are gone—so much the better:
     Having no paper, for the want of better,
     But finding no place for their landing better,
     Juan's was good; and might have been still better,
     And after all poor Frederick may do better—
     (I wish your bards would sing it rather better).
     Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better
     But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,
     That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)—
     The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,
     Take care what you reply to such a letter.
     Or cramm'd twelve sheets into one little letter,
     From Haidee's glance than any graven letter.
     Shown in the following copy of her Letter:—
     They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.
     Pray did you see her answer to his letter?'
       Which (though I hate to say a thing that 's bitter)
       Through all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter
     Magnificently mingled in a litter.
     A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,
       Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,
     And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.
     Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter
       Columbus found a new world in a cutter,
     They grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,
     Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.
       March, my Muse! If you cannot fly, yet flutter;
       Or starch, as are the edicts statesmen utter.
     And rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,
     All those may leap who rather would be neuter
     By which none were permitted to be neuter—
     For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,
     Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.
       Upon my shoulders, here I must aver
     Love may exist with marriage, and should ever,
     A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,
       But still so like, that Psyche were more clever
       Little that 's great, but much of what is clever;
     At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,
     But draw the long bow better now than ever.
     Or five, or one, or zero, she could never
     Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never
     After a sort; but somehow people never
       Thus was another Eden; they were never
       So loving and so lovely—till then never,
       Heroes sometimes, though seldom—sages never;
       And though I have seen many corpses, never
     Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,
       Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;
       And breast maternal wean'd at once for ever,—
     Senses to sleep—the power seem'd gone for ever.
     Restore me those pure feelings, gone forever.
       His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;
     While, though 't was dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.
     Is not all love prohibited whatever,
       So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,
     How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!
     Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
     Believe that virtue thaw'd before the river.'
     They blew up in the middle of the river,
       Cut from its forest root of years—the river
       Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,
       (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river
     And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,
       His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver
     This weakness in a few hours, and recover.
       For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;
       The devil 's so very sly—she should discover
       Nay, married dames will now and then discover
       And capabilities, as to discover
       With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,
       Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
       And make no further noise, till you discover
     (A 'Highland welcome' all the wide world over).
       Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet 's 'Dover!'
       And—but no matter, all those things are over;
       Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;
       Of the third sex stept up, and peering over
     Between the present and past worlds, and hover
       And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,
       The chimney—which would really hold a lover.
     Expecting all the welcome of a lover
       And, if still free, that such or such a lover
       No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,
       But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,
     In her first passion woman loves her lover,
       I 've known them court an heiress for their lover.
     A thankless husband, next a faithless lover,
       Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,
       The antechamber—search them under, over;
     Upon their airy confine, half-seas-over.
       The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
     Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.
     And begg'd they would excuse her; she 'd get over
     Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,
       But ere the middle watch was hardly over,
     (But here perhaps the instances are fewer)
     Rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,
     For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,
     These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,
       That they have nothing better near, or newer.
     When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
     She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,
     But in the country ladies seek their bower
       But after all it is the only 'bower'
     Great wish to please—a most attractive dower,
       Beauty and love were Haidee's mother's dower;
     When happiness had been their only dower,
     Quick, thick, and heavy—as a thunder-shower.
       But pays off moments in an endless shower
     To double even the sweetness of a flower.
     Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower—
       Call'd 'Parks,' where there is neither fruit nor flower
     Reset it; shave more smoothly, also slower,
     If but to keep thy credit as a mower.
     O'erflow'd her soul with their united power;
     For it had made them what they were: the power
       Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power
     Especially when added to the power.
     To open all itself, without the power
       Her human day is kindled; full of power
     Of feeling for some kindness done, when power
       And, having o'er itself no further power,
     That I should fall into a monster's power.
     Have felt that moment in its fullest power
     Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
     The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
       Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;
     While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,
       Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:
     Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.
     Of all men, saving Sylla the man-slayer,
     Ave Maria! 't is the hour of prayer!
     And yet the forest leaves seem'd stirr'd with prayer.
     In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,
     And decorates the book of Common Prayer,
     She knew the Latin—that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'
          And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,
       I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,
     Whether with time the spectre has grown shyer,
       And apt to be transferr'd to the first buyer
     From the enjoyment of the earth and air
       That waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,
     Stirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.
       Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,

       The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;
     After all), or like Irish at a fair,
     If single, probably his plighted fair
     And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,
       Small pity had he for the young and fair,
     Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,
       Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,
     She was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.
       In character—but it would not be fair
     And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair
     For some vivacity among the fair,
     They 'll only make mistakes about the fair,
     (In Moore's phrase), where the fashionable fair
     And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,
       Who, one might think, was something in the affair;
     I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair

     As though they were in a mere Christian fair
       Yet has a sentimental kind of air
     Once, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd—the thing of air,
     The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,
     A wordless music, and her face so fair
     Ave Maria! oh that face so fair!
     Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,
     Besides, as has been said, she was so fair
       He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
       O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;
     As plentiful as in a court, or fair.
     And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,
     Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,
     With other articles of ladies fair,
     No doubt I should be told that black is fair.
       But what conducted, if the question's fair,
     Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that 's fair;
       Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,
     And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,
       May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,
       The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,
       So that the outline 's tolerably fair,
     A kind of flattery that 's hardly fair
       Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;
       The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;
     Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!
     Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.
     As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.

       Whose charts lay down its current to a hair;
     There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
     Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,
       And sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:
       Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;
       With floating draperies and with flying hair,
     Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,
       That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair—
       Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:
     Her face declined and was unseen; her hair
       And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
     The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,
       Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;
     Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair
     Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.
     One difficulty still remain'd—his hair
     As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair
       When the stripp'd forest bows to the bleak air,
     The lady rising up with such an air
       As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:
       The grass my table-cloth, in open-air,
     The lawyers in the study; and in air
     Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,
     With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)
     In happier plight than if they form'd a pair.
     Excepting our first parents, such a pair
       The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;
       He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair—
     I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.
     And now I will proceed upon the pair.
     'T is—'t is her father's—fix'd upon the pair!
       And sent one on a summons to the pair,
     First but for one, and after for the pair;
     I 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,
     To Norman Abbey whirl'd the noble pair,—
     And found much linen, lace, and several pair
       Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair
     Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair
       I 'll take Juanna; we 're a slenderer pair
       But overwrought with passion and despair,
       And half forgot their danger and despair:
     A low soft ottoman), and black despair
     Yet what can people do, except despair?
     Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair
       The book which treats of this erroneous pair,
     And thus they form'd a rather curious pair,
       To leave together this imprudent pair,
     But all the better, for the happy pair
       Enough.—The faithful and the fairy pair,
       O!—the third canto—and the pretty pair—
       His suffocation by that pretty pair;
       She seem'd by the distraction of her air.
       They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air
     Beating for love, as the caged bird's for air.
     Who wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,
       Besides the mark'd distinction of his air,
       And ever-dying Gladiator's air,
       As o'er him the calm and stirless air:
     And I shall take a much more serious air
     Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air
       Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,
          For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,
       Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,
       Him borne into the house and up the stair,
     And not a breath crept through the rosy air,
     Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.
     Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
          For he is yet the church's heir
       You 'd better ask our mistress who 's his heir.'

     If in the course of such a life as was
     'Lucus a non lucendo,' not what was,
     Might make the matter still worse than it was.
       As rum and true religion: thus it was,
     To say what it was not than what it was.
     I cannot tell exactly what it was;
     In judging men—when once his judgment was
     Like Archimedes, I leave earth as 't was.
       There were some other reasons: the first was,
     Self-love, there 's safety in a crowd of coxcombs.
       Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;
       Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,
       To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,
     Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,
     But I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,
     And this reflection brings me to plain physics,
     Meant to personify the mathematics.
     I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics

       By all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads,

       Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,

     At least he feels it, and some say he sees,

       Country, where a young couple of the same ages

     But here a messenger brought in despatches:
     To colour up his rays from your despatches.
     They stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.
     And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.
     Souls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches

     The dinner made about a hundred dishes;
     Another part of history; for the dishes

       In his harmonious settlement (which flourishes
     These first twelve books are merely flourishes,

     Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,
       Who have a due respect for their own wishes.
       Who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,

     And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
     By general subscription of the ladies.
     And such sweet girls—I mean, such graceful ladies,
     While the mild emerald's beam shades down the dies

     Whether there are such things as sympathies
       With all we can imagine of the skies,
       Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,
       Would you have endless lightning in the skies?
     As he who studies fervently the skies
       Of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,
     To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;—
       Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;
       I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
     Especially when they would look like lies;

     Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,
     But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.
     Which Satan angles with for souls, like flies.
       And in perspective many a squadron flies:
     Who think that novelties are butterflies
     Of colour'd garbs, as bright as butterflies.
     To pass, than those two cantos into families.

     Round Juan's head, and his around her lies

     According to the best of dictionaries,
     Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,
       Their station: there were valets, secretaries,
       Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies
     Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,
     I 'd try conclusions with those Janizaries,

     Back to their chambers, those long galleries
     Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,

     With a long memorandum of old stories.
     And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
       In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories
       As any mention'd in the histories
       Sat little Leila, who survived the parries
       That being the last thing a proud woman tries;
     From those of other lands unblest with juries,
     Could risk or compass such strange phantasies,
     Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies
     To use all fit and proper courtesies,
     And yet they had their little jealousies,
       And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,
     I therefore deal in generalities.
       And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
       A great opinion of her own good qualities;
     And the new births of both their stale virginities
     Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.
     Some drama of the marriage unities,
       And wherefore blame gaunt wealth's austerities?
     'T is said that persons living on annuities

     His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;
     He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,
     Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,
     His beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,
       The priest instructs, and so our life exhales,
     Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales
     Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,
       Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
       A ready answer, which at once enables
       By a few timely words to turn the tables,
     Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,
     Like man's vain glory, and his vainer troubles.
       And in the worn and wild receptacles
       To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;
     Much in the mode of Goethe's Mephistopheles;
     While great Lucullus' Robe triumphal muffles
     Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.
     To these the invention of champagne and truffles:
     (There 's fame) young partridge fillets, deck'd with truffles.
     Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,
     Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.
     And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.
       She grew to womanhood, and between whiles
     But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,
     And, when a holiday upon them smiles,
       Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
     Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.
     Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,
     Or hope, or love, with any of the wiles
     They heard next day—that in the Dardanelles,
     Entomb'd the bravest of the brave, Achilles;
       And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,
       Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,
       Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples
       With all kinds of incorrigible samples
       Seduced by youth and dangerous examples,
       The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;
     But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
     The worst of tempests and the best of battles
     Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,
     Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,
     Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.
     Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.
     And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,
       With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
     Fair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames
     For both commodities dwell by the Thames,
     The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.
       A want of that true nature which sublimes
       As is the custom of those Eastern climes,
     Perhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes

     They turn out melodrames or pantomimes.
       Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:
     And one good action in the midst of crimes
       Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,
       A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;
     In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;
     Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,
     Were sonnets to herself, or 'bouts rimes.'
     Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,
     Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes—
     As those of Aristotle, though sometimes
       Though 't was not once so. If I sneer sometimes,
     (The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes
     The Turks do well to shut—at least, sometimes—
       Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;
       Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.
     Exceedingly remarkable at times,
     The gentle Juan flourish'd, though at times
       They look'd so little, did strong things at times—
     When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'
     Though hardly heard through multifarious 'damme's'-
     And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's
       Some female head most curiously presumes
     And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,
     Which shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,
     Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)—
     My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.
       Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.
       The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;
     But not at all adapted to my rhymes.
       And now and then it also suits my rhymes.
     When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'
     And when well practised in these mimic scenes,
     On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,
     But London 's so well lit, that if Diogenes
       As ere that awful period intervenes
     In former works, made new, prepared fascines,
     Also he dress'd up, for the nonce, fascines
     And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines
       Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,
     And made them charge with bayonet these machines,
     And all kinds of benevolent machines.
       Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,
     The answer eloquent, where soul shines
     Because the sun, and stars, and aught that shines,
     Taste or the gout,—pronounce it as inclines
     And read (the only book she could) the lines
     We left our heroes and our heroines
     An English autumn, though it hath no vines,
     The paths, o'er which the far festoon entwines
     Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;
     In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.
     As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,
     In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;
     She stood a moment as a Pythones
     We have no accomplish'd blackguards, like Tom Jones,
     And when you hear historians talk of thrones,
       Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;—
       For I will teach, if possible, the stones
     For when his pious consort gave him stones
     Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,
     But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.
       To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,
     And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,
     This were the worst desertion:—renegadoes,
     Would scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'
       Such small distinction between friends and foes,
     Who held the place, and to assist the foe's.
       And flew at all she met, as on her foes;
     Of war's most mortal engines, to their foes
     Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,
     Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes—
     Rush'd where the thickest fire announced most foes.
     As any man's day mixture undergoes.
     I sketch your world exactly as it goes.
       Some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;
     When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.
     O'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,
     That sad result of passions and potatoes—
     Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,
     Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
     'Alas, poor ghost!'—What unexpected woes
     A thing to counterbalance human woes:
     Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?
     Not even a vision of his former woes
     Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.
       Happier than they who still perceived their woes;
     Whate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:
       With such serenity her husband's woes,
     But none of them appear'd to share his woes,
     Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes
     Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
     Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
     Just as Koutousow's most 'forlorn' of 'hopes'
     I know not if he had domestic cares—
     Not having of my own domestic cares.
     Continued still her hospitable cares;
     While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,
     Some run away, and but exchange their cares,
     The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.
     When they suspect that any one goes shares
     And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,

     A pail of housemaid's water unawares.
     Such I might stumble over unawares,
     And shine the very Siria of the spheres,

     Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.
       Discuss'd the world, and settled all the spheres;
     Without a small refreshment from the spheres.
     They moved like stars united in their spheres,
       Swore praises, and recall'd their former fires;
     And then of course the circle much admires,
     (None trusts the sex more, or so much admires—
     Most naturally some small doubt inspires—
     And the pause follow'd, which when song expires
       Indulgence of their innocent desires;
     The approach of home to husbands and to sires,
       Haidee forgot the island was her sire's;
       The boors cried 'Dang it? who 'd have thought it?'—Sires,
       At least in the beginning, ere one tires;
       He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires
     The lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires
     In Catherine's reign, whom glory still adores,

       Or wilder group of savage Salvatore's;

     Else how the devil is it that fresh features
     You read my stanzas, and I read your features:
     The gate so splendid was in all its features,
       Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features
     Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures—
     You never thought about those little creatures,
     Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?
       'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;
     Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,
     Still I have no dislike to learned natures,
       Some by a place—as tend their years or natures;
       Or on the morning papers read their lectures,
     Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,
       And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,
       And made upon the hot-house several strictures,
     On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.
     Into the excursive, breaking the indentures
     Some rumour also of some strange adventures
       By winds and waves, and some important captures;

       For the imagination or the senses,
     To love, there are those things which words name senses;
     Nothing more true than not to trust your senses;
     As the sole sign of man's being in his senses
     As Juan should have known, had not his senses
     A small old spaniel,—which had been Don Jose's,
     And recollect a poet nothing loses
     Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),
     I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,
     For on such things the memory reposes
     To corps, the greater part of which were corses.
       For the Lord Henry, link'd with dogs and horses.

       Take lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:
       Leaving as ladders their heap'd carcasses,
     I have seen some nations like o'erloaded asses
     Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.
     All that the mind would shrink from of excesses;
       Too dull even for the dullest of excesses,
       Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
     The innocence which happy childhood blesses,
     Were proved by competent false witnesses.
       Cure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;
     Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,
     And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.
     Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,
     All that defies the worst which pen expresses;
     Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,
     Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,
     And truculent distortion of their tresses.

     Truths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,

     And thus your houri (it may be) disputes
       From ignorance of danger, which indues
     If fallen in evil days on evil tongues,
     A portion of your fading twilight hues,
       Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;
     Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'

     Let him take care that that which he pursues
     The bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,
     That most unliquidating liquid, leaves
       Eve made up millinery with fig leaves—
     As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves
           My own the burning tear-drop laves,
           To think such breasts must suckle slaves
     Lash'd from the foam of ages; while the graves
     Of empires heave but like some passing waves.
       That many of the ills o'er which man grieves,
     And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,
       As far as I know, that the church receives:
     The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.
     Yet made the misery of at least two lives.

       And who that recollects young years and loves,—
       Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;
     When amatory poets sing their loves
     So that there was no reason for their loves
       Of sober reason wheresoe'er it moves,
     The greater their success the worse it proves,
       And palsied fancy, which no longer roves
       And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves
     And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,
       (Not the most 'dainty Ariel') and perplexes
     There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,
       Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,
     By turns the difference of the several sexes;
       And that which after all my spirit vexes,
     A vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes
     Of arms (in the East all arm)—and various dyes
     Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,
     He will forgive us—yes—it must be—yes.
     But else unhurt, she open'd her large eyes,
       Shawl'd to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,
     The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
     Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)
     ''T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes
     And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,

     Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,

     (Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.
       And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,
     His Highness cast around his great black eyes,
     Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes
     Had bow'd themselves before th' imperial eyes,
       Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes
       Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
       In short, it is the use of our own eyes,
     At least,—and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,
     Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes
       The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,
     Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
       Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes
     They look upon each other, and their eyes
       Upon its course), pass'd oft before their eyes,
       Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,
     But very difficult, to shut their eyes.
     And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.
       Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;
     But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,
     Emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,
       And long he paused to re-assure his eyes
       An age—expectant, powerless, with his eyes
     'T is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'
     So fully flash'd the phantom on his eyes,
     Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
     Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.
     With time and trials, and those helpless eyes
     Heaven knows? But Adeline's malicious eyes
       They shall appear before your curious eyes,
     The little Leila, with her orient eyes,

     The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
     There 's more than one edition, and the readings
     If you would like to see the whole proceedings,
     Enough to gratify a bee's slight munchings;
     O, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things—
     Of youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things
     'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,
       Without strong reason, of those sort of things:'
       Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:
     Wealth had done wonders—taste not much; such things
     I leave the thing a problem, like all things.
     The antique Persians taught three useful things,

       In any body's business but the king's:'
     Good company 's a chess-board—there are kings,
     This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings—
     Diplomatists of rather wavering kings,
     In the more chasten'd domes of Western kings
     Statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings,
     Whate'er of peace about our hearthstone clings,
     Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings
     So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,
       From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;
       How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;
       Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;
     Besides the ministers and underlings,
     There 's doubtless something in domestic doings
     Of this same mystic friar's curious doings,
     For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,
     About the present family's deaths and wooings.
     Romances paint at full length people's wooings,
       She hardly knew, to such perfection brings
       Treating a topic which, alas! but brings
       I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,
       Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.
     A lecture and some money: for four springs
     To trace all actions to their secret springs
       (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,
       Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;
     The very clerks,—those somewhat dirty springs

     My trembling lyre already several strings,
     Save that the puppets pull at their own strings,
     Bows have they, generally with two strings;
       Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,
     The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings
       And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings
     Of which most men partake, but no one sings.
     I think I hear a little bird, who sings
       The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings
     (As every kind of parting has its stings),
       And wishing that post-horses had the wings
     To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,
     My Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,
     And dandies, all are gone on the wind's wings.
       Streaming from off the sun like seraph's wings,
     Which for an instant clip enjoyment's wings.
     If Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs
     He deigned not to belie his soul in songs,
     And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,

     I 'll prove that such the opinion of the critic is

       All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;

     If free from passion, which all friendship checks,

     The sun himself was scarce more free from specks

     The dream changed:—in a cave she stood, its walls
     Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls
       In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,
     More to secure them in their naval cells,
       Over the shining pebbles and the shells,
     St. James's Palace and St. James's 'Hells.'

     Their folly in forgetting there are fools.
     And persecuted sages teach the schools
       Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;

     Were strung together like a row of pearls,
     And further on a group of Grecian girls,
       And Lady Marys blooming into girls,

     Down her white neck long floating auburn curls
     All the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls

     Against his heart preferr'd their usual claims,
     There 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
     Some plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,
     The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms
       A marble fountain echoes through the glooms
       On through a farther range of goodly rooms,
     They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.
     But Juan never left them, while they had charms,
     Down to the harp—because to music's charms
       Sustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;
       His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,
       And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,
     'Observe your lover when he leaves your arms;'
       And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,
       So styled according to the usual forms
       To those sad hungry jacobins the worms,
     On which, at the third asking of the bans,
       Of all the pillars of the state, which leans
       His daily council upon ways and means
     Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means.
       A lady of a 'certain age,' which means
     Unless a man can calculate his means
       This modern Amazon and queen of queans;
     Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.
       As also of the first academicians:
     For Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,
       Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,
     His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians
     And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,
     And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,
     His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,
       Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,
     Her climacteric teased her like her teens;
       I know not, never counting past their teens;
     But she was lucky, and luck 's all. Your queens
       But both were thrown away amongst the fens;
       No longer ready ears and short-hand pens
       (Who at sixteen translated 'Hercules Furens'
       Mild, but at times a sort of Hercules furens;
       Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,
     And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,
     But after, there are sometimes certain signs
     Quite independent of the Zodiac's signs,
     With God and man's abhorrence for its gains.
     A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,
     Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.
       Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;
       And such things as the entrails and the brains
       The hour, as is the case with lively brains;
       And the loud cannon peal'd his hoarsest strains,
       Preferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing veins:
     The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,
       For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins
     Have shaving too entail'd upon their chins,—
       Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins
     Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,
     Condemn'd to child-bed, as men for their sins
     Which surely were invented for our sins,—
     His afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons,
     In riding round those vegetable puncheons
       But I won't weep!—and so drive on, postilions!
     Have princes who spur more than their postilions.
       Juan admired these highways of free millions;
     To Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions
       For such precedence upon such occasions
       The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:
     I pray ye flog them upon all occasions,
       Had something ready upon most occasions—
     No more to be beheld but in such visions—
       Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:
     To females of perspicuous comprehensions,
     His orders, also to receive his pensions,
     His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,
     Bought up for different purposes and passions.
     As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
     Which make the reader envy his transgressions.
     But as he had some lucid intermissions,
     Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.
     The best of mothers and of educations
       Of gentle dames, among whose recreations
     It chanced some diplomatical relations,
     He wrote to Spain:—and all his near relations,
     He bore these sneers against his near relations,
     He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
       The admirations and the speculations;
       He varied with some skill his adulations;
       Round the young man with their congratulations.
       Out between friends as well as allied nations:
     But leave them to the conscience of the nations.
       In the dissolving circle, all the nations'
     O ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,
       Amongst our own most musical of nations;
     Which scarce even France, the paragon of nations,
       And knew the self-loves of the different nations;
     Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.
     Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.
     Expectant of the ghost's fresh operations.
     These few short years make wondrous alterations,
     Several prepared themselves for emigrations;
     Volumes with similar sad illustrations,
     To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.
     She liked quick answers in all conversations;
     (By those who have not had such visitations),
     Of getting on himself, and finding stations
     Writing despatches) in their several stations,
     Himself and Juan in their mutual stations
     Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,
     But buried in the heap of such transactions
     But here are men who fought in gallant actions
     A third, because there can be no objections.
     O Catherine! (for of all interjections,
     Safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.
     In love and war) how odd are the connections
     At their lord's, son's, or similar connection's
     A second for her excellent connections;
     Just now yours were cut out in different sections:
       Survive through very desperate conditions,
       As any of Mortality's conditions;
     Yet when they ask'd her for her depositions,
       Was one of their most favourite positions.
     Was Adeline well versed, as compositions.
     Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
       A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,
     Aurora at the last (so history mentions,
     Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.
     All propagated with the best intentions;
     Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,
       With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,
       And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
     This is the patent-age of new inventions
       Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,
       Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;
       No fashion made them apes of her distortions;
     And now he rose; and after due ablutions
     And prayers and other pious evolutions,
       Or any such like sovereign buffoons,
       More than such madmen's fellow man—the moon's?
       And I grown one of many 'wooden spoons'
     But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,
     Professors of that genial art, and patrons
       As Captain Parry's voyage may do to Jason's.
       Lower'd, leaven'd, like a history of freemasons;
       My music has some mystic diapasons;
     He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,
       Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons
     From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,
     And throwing back a dim look on his sons,
       A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,
     Through Kennington and all the other 'tons,'
     'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.
     Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?
     Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!
     Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,
     The former in a palace, where like nuns
     Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,
     First out of, and then back again to chaos,
     As Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.
     And hew out a huge monument of pathos,
     The 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!'
     The 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!'
     O! the long evenings of duets and trios!
     Ugly; for instance—Ninon de l'Enclos.
     And 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos'
       I only say suppose it—inter nos.
     Save that of dreaming once 'mal-a-propos.'
     Two weeds which pose our economic Catos.
     Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.
     But how shall I relate in other cantos
     Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
     Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps
     You 'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.
     He wishes for 'a boat' to sail the deeps—
     We learn from Horace, 'Homer sometimes sleeps;'
     To show with what complacency he creeps,
     Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.
     And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,
     Juan and Johnson join'd a certain corps,
     Nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps):—
       He hers, until they end in broken gasps;
       Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps
       Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;
     Open'd the gate call'd 'Kilia,' to the groups
       Of air-balloons, and of the many bars
     But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,
     There 's music in all things, if men had ears:
     I rather think the moon should date the dears.
       To introduce a bon-mot head and ears;
       Because that number rarely much endears,
     No doubt we weep for those the heart endears—
       For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,
     Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,
       There were the six Miss Rawbolds—pretty dears!
     I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:
       And of the folly of all prudish fears,
     Gave her a right to have maternal fears
     Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,
     She stood as one who champion'd human fears—
       It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,
     Or for so young a husband's jealous fears
     And if he wept at length, they were not fears
     Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,
       And all lips were applied unto all ears!
     And as the spot where they appear he nears,
     Where mingled and yet separate appears
     But there is something when man's eye appears
       Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears
       A visitant at intervals appears;
       He climb'd to where the parapet appears;
       But by 'the bookish theoric' it appears,
     Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
     These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,
     The women with their hair about their ears
       Is, that whatever bar the reason rears
       And intellect, that neither eyes nor ears
       To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
     A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,
     A melody which made him doubt his ears,
     Of feeling: for however habit sears
       Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,
     Of earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears
     I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
     Such as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true—tears
     Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.
     Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears
     A minute past, and she had been all tears,
     And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.
     My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.
     Pours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,
     And turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!
     And then of these some part burst into tears,
     So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.
       She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
     Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,
     That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.
       In fix'd ferocity, when joyous tears
     He died, deserving well his country's tears,
     She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,
       Smiled as she talk'd the matter o'er; but tears
       There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;
     'Tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears
     And then the mother cries, the father swears,
       The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.
     Opinions wear out in some thousand years,
       That in the course of some six thousand years,

     Of—but Chronology best knows the years.
     While a few pray'd (the first time for some years)—
     There was no great disparity of years,
       A moment's good thing may have cost them years

     Thus much however I may add,—her years
     These forty days' advantage of her years—
     Unwelcome visions of our former years,
       A pleasant thing to young men at their years.
     Some reckon women by their suns or years,
     Which make the English climate of our years.
       Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,
     Had soil'd the current of her sinless years,
       That, adding to the account his Highness' years,
       And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
     But six old damsels, each of seventy years,
     To lose by one month's frost some twenty years
     'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
     Of others' feeling; but they are such liars,
     In number'd lots; they all had cuffs and collars,
     And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.
     Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
     So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,
     At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,
     That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,
     At Halifax;' but now he served the Tartars.
       That these were merely masquerading Tartars,
     To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,
       Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
     There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
       And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
     Bellona, what you will—they mean but wars.
     The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,
     Motion was in their days, rest in their slumbers,
     Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;

     This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,

     And evidences which regale all readers.

       A book, friend, single lady, or a glass

     Slowly distill'd into the glimmering glass
       O'er life, too sweet an image for such glass,
       The freest she that ever gazed on glass;
     A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,
       If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,
     The coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,
       They must wait several weeks before a mass
       A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.

     Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less
       By one three talents, for there were no less—
       They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;

     There is a flower call'd 'Love in Idleness,'
       To say is, not that love is idleness,
     Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.
     I say, methinks that 'Philo-genitiveness'
       Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;
     Of Britain's present wealth and happiness;—
       Was what he call'd the 'Art of Happiness;'
     Turns out to be a butcher in great business,
     Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.
     A tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,
     Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.
       A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,
     But merely their parental tenderness,

     Knock'd to inform him it was time to dress.
     But for that hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,
     Don Juan was presented, and his dress
     His figure, and the splendour of his dress,
       There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.
     Give gently way, when there 's too great a press;
     But in such matters Russia's mighty empress
     That novelties please less than they impress.
       Around them, made them to each other press,
       In such a trifle, scarcely could express
       Of any thing which nature would express;
       All that the best can mingle and express
       Among the foremost; but if you 'd express
       And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,
       He sate with feelings awkward to express
       Slight but select, and just enough to express,
       And being present, now began to express
       Your men of business are not apt to express
     This feeling 't is not easy to express,
       Of course the others could not but express
       Indifference certes don't produce distress;
     To weather out much longer; the distress

       Having been several days in great distress,

       Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
       For Adeline is half a poetess,'
       Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,
     Many of common readers give a guess
     Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,
     Which is the only cause that we can guess
       Though probably much less a fact than guess)
       In heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;
       An accessory, as I have cause to guess.
     Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess
       At least his manner suffers not to guess
     And though his meaning they could rarely guess,
       Of sense and song above your graves may hiss—
     Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;
       Defying augury with that fond kiss;
     Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss
     And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:
     Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;—
     Of pleasure and of pain—even while I kiss
       There 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:
     His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
     Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss
       Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss
       This is true criticism, and you may kiss—
     Or Germany, where people purely kiss.
     Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss
     Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
     That nobody can ever take amiss,
     In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,—
     But never yet (except of course a miss
     The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
     Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,
     That passengers would find it much amiss
     Thought her predictions went not much amiss,
     Explains the garb which Juan took amiss.
     Now this he really rather took amiss:
     But it suffices—little was amiss;
     Could not at first expound what was amiss.
       But I 'm resolved to say nought that 's amiss)—
     Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss
       Some people prefer wine—'t is not amiss;
     One of the valorous 'Smiths' whom we shall miss
       In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,
     Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,
     For aught we know.) Renown 's all hit or miss;
       The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss
       Awaits at last even those who longest miss
     Perhaps mankind might find the path they miss—
       Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,
       Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;
     In balancing the profit and the loss,
     In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss
     Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.
       Never could she survive that common loss;
       But the same cause, conducive to his loss,
     And cared as little for his army's loss
       But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
     The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,
       And adding still a little through each cross
       As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,
     To waste so much gold for a little dross,
     Who calculated life as so much dross,
     Like gold as in comparison to dross,
       The gamester's counter, or the statesman's dross.
     History can only take things in the gross;
     Suwarrow,—who but saw things in the gross,
     Young men who—though they hated to discuss
     To show it (points we need not now discuss)—
     Yet neither frighten'd by a female fuss,
       Clings to its teat—sticks to me through the abyss
     Some waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss
     If from great nature's or our own abyss
       Contempt, but from the bathos' vast abyss
       Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,
       The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats
     As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,
       Full grows his bag, and wonderful his feats.
       Lamb and pistachio nuts—in short, all meats,
     And as she treats all things, and ne'er retreats
     As also bonfires made of country seats;
       Their bread as ministers and favourites (that 's
       Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats

       You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;
     Who fatten on their country's gore, and debts,

       To plays in five, and operas in three acts;
       She gathers a repertory of facts,
     All these are, certes, entertaining facts,
     So that I do not grossly err in facts,
       To history, tradition, and to facts,
       For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;
     Like Titus' youth, and Caesar's earliest acts;
       But that which more completely faith exacts
     Like Cromwell's pranks;—but although truth exacts
     Philosophy? No: she too much rejects.
     Religion? Yes; but which of all her sects?
     After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets
       The beverage was various sherbets
     The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,
     A row of gentlemen along the streets
     'T is true there be some bitters with the sweets,
       The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.
     And when at last the pretty creature gets

       A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,
       One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;

     The Blues, that tender tribe who sigh o'er sonnets,
     Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets
     Also the eighty 'greatest living poets,'
       But theirs was love in which the mind delights
       And distant from each other burn'd the lights,
       Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,
     The world to gaze upon those northern lights
     Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,
     And set the other halt of earth to rights;
       And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,
     He also had been busy seeing sights—
     She fell with Buonaparte—What strange thoughts
     That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
     Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.
     A wilderness of the most rare conceits,
     As going at full speed—no matter where its
     While others have a genius turn'd for fits.

     And merely for the sake of its own merits;
     Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,
     There 's pretty picking in those 'petits puits.'
     Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.
     And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,
       Examples may be found of such pursuits:
     As every paltry magazine can show its.
     With music; the most moderate shine as wits;
       And long the latest of arrivals halts,
     A modern Ancient Pistol—by the hilts?
     Although the highest: but as swords have hilts
     When man in battle or in quarrel tilts,
     Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,
     Don Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,
       Makes one in love even with its very faults.
     Pillow'd on her o'erflowing heart, which pants
     With all it granted, and with all it grants.
     Ah, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!
     Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.
     And ah, ye poachers!—'T is no sport for peasants.
     Where are those martyr'd saints the Five per Cents?
     Despite of all their efforts and expedients,
     Into the opening; but all such ingredients
     Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,
     And where—oh, where the devil are the rents?
     Upon his cabinet, besides the presents
     Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,
     And lived contentedly, without complaints,
       So well not one of the aforesaid paints
       He did not take such studies for restraints;
       And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
     Juan—in this respect, at least, like saints—
     May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.
     O that my words were colours! but their tints
     All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:
     As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;
     Await those who have studied their bon-mots!
     And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;
       Like poplars, with good principles for roots;
       At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:
       By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,
     But Juan was a bachelor—of arts,
       Where different talents find their different marts;
       Form'd a whole which, irregular in parts,
       Some new experiment to show his parts;
       Of his own nature, and the various arts,
     Or cheerful, without any 'flaws or starts,'
     An air as sentimental as Mozart's
       And mingling modestly in toils or sports.
       Was all things unto people of all sorts,
       In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts—
       To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.
     I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,
     How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests
     (Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests
     But) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests
       Albeit all human history attests
       The party we have touch'd on were the guests:
     Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;
       The matron frown'd: 'Why so?'—'For fear of ghosts,'
     Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts
       Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts.'
       A phantom upon each of the four posts;
     For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,
     And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,
     And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,
     Was much inferior to King Menelaus:—
       Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,
     Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus—
     Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.
     The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.

     While that 'hiatus maxime deflendus'

     This is the way physicians mend or end us,
     In health—when ill, we call them to attend us,
     With suits and prosecutions they besiege us,
     Whose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!
     Who to immoral courses would allure us
     If only from the devil they would insure us,
     Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)
     Because she was not apt, like some of us,
     To prove the public debt is not consuming us—
     No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
     Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,
     I 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,
     As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
       (The hypocrite!), will banish them like Marius,
     Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,
       Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,
     Who lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.
     Without whom Venus will not long attack us.
     So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.
     'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'
     When we know what all are, we must bewail us,
     Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,

     A real husband always is suspicious,
       Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:
     Was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.
     By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;
     If any said so, for to be precocious
     Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,
     Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.
     Examples of this kind are so contagious,
     And not the least so when they are religious,
     It is observed that ladies are litigious
     He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.
     Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,
       Have fill'd their papers with their comments various,
     Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,

     For certain reasons my belief is serious.

     'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,
       And critically held as deleterious:
     That source of the sublime and the mysterious:—
     'Quite well; yes,—no.'—These answers were mysterious,
     However they might savour of delirious;
     Just to console sad glory for being glorious;
       Reaping allusions private and inglorious,
     For instance—passion in a lover 's glorious,
       By naming streets: since men are so censorious,
     To those who were, or pass'd for meritorious,
       Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,

     I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
     'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
     All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.
     'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
       For making squares and streets anonymous;
       Or on his mistress—terms synonymous—
     Because the good old man had so much 'nous,'

     Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous
     Gliding the first time to a rendezvous,
     As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)
     Of the 'Star Chamber' than of 'Habeas Corpus.'
     Thou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus
     The king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,
     The sensual for a short time but connects us,
     At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'
     The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,
     But has not answer'd like the apparatus
     With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'
     The superstratum which will overlay us.

       Although when long a little apt to weary us;

     He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws
     Knowing they must be settled by the laws.
     Doors there were many, through which, by the laws
       They drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws

     From counsel learned in those kinds of laws
     With all their chaste integrity of laws,
       Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws
       Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,
     Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,
       Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:
     But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
       As a great favour one of the fore-paws,
       On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,—
     Or, if he dance not, but hath higher views
     So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews
       How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,
       And others rose to the command of crews
       The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;
     Retired: with most unfashionable bows
     The ruling passion, such as marble shows
       Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows
       'Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;'
       To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows

     The field is universal and allows
       At least as far as bienseance allows:
     She was all which pure ignorance allows,
     When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
     But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,
     And full of sentiments, sublime as billows
     Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows

     Like many people everybody knows,

     Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),

     I think I should have made monastic vows,
       That young men rarely made monastic vows;
     Haidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,
     These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,
     By which such things are settled now-a-days.
     A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,
     That innovation's spirit now-a-days
     Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,
       Reversing the good custom of old days,
       When nights are equal, but not so the days;

       Their never knowing their own mind two days,

     The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,
     The love of higher things and better days;
       Epoch, that awkward corner turn'd for days
       With regular descent, in these our days,
     Enjoy'd the lonely, vigorous, harmless days
       But every fool describes in these bright days
     Of merit, and complaint of present days
       Such kisses as belong to early days,
       The world will find thee after many days.'
     And also hearts, if there be truth in lays.
       Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;—
       His parts of speech; and in the strange displays
       And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,

     But just to play with, as an infant plays.

     And here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,
       Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says;
       Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,
       While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,
       Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;

       In all, who o'er the great deep take their ways:

       Being no sibyl in the new world's ways;

     Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways
       Our passions, and we walk in wisdom's ways;

     No more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,
       Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
     Who furrow some new soil to sow for joys.
     Both maladies are taxes on our joys:
       And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,
       By the mere senses; and that which destroys
     From thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,
     Ye powers! it is the—the—the—Pooh! the cat!

     Few mortals know what end they would be at,
       Good God! I wonder what they would be at!

     But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,
       To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
     Joy of its alchymy, and to repeat
       The mischief, after all, could not be great,
       When homicide and harlotry made great;
     And Death, the sovereign's sovereign, though the great
     Most men are slaves, none more so than the great,
       As most men do, the little or the great;
     Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.

       Just as he really promised something great,
       Amongst the sex in little things or great.
       By which such sirens can attract our great,
     But on the whole their continence was great;
     For Haidee's knowledge was by no means great,

     Her resolutions were most truly great,
       Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat

     What though on Lethe's stream he seem to float,
     It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,
       As fast as oars could pull and water float;
     But still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float
       That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:
       You know the rest.' The words stuck in her throat,
     So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,
     For me, I deem an absolute autocrat
       The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat
     They fill the canvas up—and 'verbum sat.'
       I say that there 's the place—but 'Verbum sat.'
       And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;
     Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at
     To give some rebel Pacha a cravat;
     His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;
     Although 'tis true that you turned out a Tory at
     Meantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,
       And for which Nature might forego her debt—
       The very Suicide that pays his debt
       To tell how he reduced the nation's debt;
     That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,
       Or like a system coupled with a doubt;
     With all the pomp of power, it was a doubt
     This I could prove beyond a single doubt,
     Who (after some discussion and some doubt,
     And put the business past all kind of doubt.
       I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;
     Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,
       He was in love,—as you would be, no doubt,
       Excepting marriage? which is love, no doubt,
       For such all women are at first no doubt.
       Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:
       So good an opportunity, no doubt:—
       The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt—
     I almost lately have begun to doubt
     Will hint allusions never meant. Ne'er doubt
       Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:
     For they, who were most ravenous in the act,
     I think with Alexander, that the act
     Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,
     Transform'd their lords to beasts (but that 's a fact).
       A lady always distant from the fact:
       He flew into a passion, and in fact
       To be Italians, as they were in fact;
       Juan had not betray'd himself; in fact
     'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,
     If not in poetry, at least in fact;
     Makes us feel our mortality in fact
     Of which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,
       Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,
       Which was an odd one; a troop going to act
       But it will serve to keep my verse compact)—
       Except in such a way as not to attract;
       Silence is best, besides there is a tact
       Because a foolish or imprudent act
       To teach his people to be more exact,
     Our gentle Adeline had one defect—
       From off the marble, which had no defect.
     For one a songstress who hath no defect,
     The cause of this effect, or this defect,—
       Might have from time acquired some slight defect;
       Could remedy this lubberly defect;
       Before they reach'd a spot to take effect:
       And for the moment it had some effect;
     But so far the immediate effect
     Whate'er the cause are orphans in effect.
     'T were difficult to say what was the object
     To bear on what appear'd to her the subject
     For this a lady no one can reject,
     Perhaps she merely had the simple project
       The public mind,—so few are the elect;
     A thing quite necessary to the elect,
       To entertain, this autumn, a select
     From these they will be careful to select,
     O ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,
     The sufferers, be't in heart or intellect,
       Between his own and others' intellect;
       According to all hints I could collect
     Of all the Muses that I recollect,
     Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect
     Or pretty, is a thing to recollect
     Which I with their amusement will connect
       A thousand pities also with respect
       (Although their talk 's obscure and circumspect),
       Without the apparel of being circumspect:
     In which you cannot be too circumspect,
     Is what I have not leisure to inspect;
     The public approbation I expect,
       Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?
       And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect

     Thus in the East they are extremely strict,
     Good at all things, but better at a bet.
     Of all our modern battles, I will bet
       Still their salvation was an even bet:
     The walls were won, but 't was an even bet

       O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,
     Haste—haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet—
     There was a self-will even in her small feet,
     And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,
     But when on the lieutenant at her feet
     Haidee and Juan carpeted their feet
     Thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,
     'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,
       And something roll'd before her in a sheet,
       Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,
       And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,
     When the sale of new books is not so fleet
       And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,
       Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,

       But be it as it may, a bard must meet
       And death is drunk with gore: there 's not a street
     Day has not broke—there 's no one in the street:
       Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;
     With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,
     Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
     Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;
     Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,
       Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet
       A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,
     The whole court look'd immediately most sweet,
     Which she essay'd in vain to clear (how sweet
     But up she got, and up she made them get,
       Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get

     With—several other things, which I forget,
     My heart is feminine, nor can forget—
     And made a scene men do not soon forget;
     I 've also seen some wives (not to forget
     Or if these do not move you, don't forget

           Of two such lessons, why forget

     And as a servant some preferment get;

     In twice five years the 'greatest living poet,'
     Was weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,

     Upon debate: the papers echoed yet
       The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet
     As certain;—these are paltry things, and yet
       Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet
     If Antony be well remember'd yet,
           Eternal summer gilds them yet,
       It is because I do not know them yet;
     Alas! by all experience, seldom yet

       And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
     Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft
     They and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left
     Young Juan and his lady-love were left
       Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;
       Of which young passion cannot be bereft,
     Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,
     Sigh'd to behold them of their hours bereft,

       Sink o'er the earth so beautiful and soft,
       A borough is comprised along the height
     But always at a most provoking height;—
       Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height
     Some thought her rather masculine in height,
       As if to win a part from off the weight
       Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,
       Of Britain's youth depends upon their weight,
     But luckily of no great length or weight.
     But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.

       Around us ever, rarely to alight?
       Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;

     Such was his tact, he could alike delight
     Which ministers unto the soul's delight,
     And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,
       Half letting in long shadows on the light,
       Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light
     Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
       Such as the times may furnish. 'T is a flight
       Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.
     There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,
       The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight,
       Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!
       She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.
     He flitted to and fro a dancing light,
     Of the arm'd river, while with straggling light
       And saw each other's dark eyes darting light

          With sword in hand, and torch to light
     All bashfully to struggle into light.
       The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
     Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?

       And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?

     'Let there be light! said God, and there was light!'
       But closed its little being without light,

     And Juan, on retiring for the night,
     Who like a morning slumber—for the night
       How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,
     Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night
     Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.
     Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,
       Those little glitterers of the London night;
     I know not why, but in that hour to-night,
     'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night—
     Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
     A neat, snug study on a winter's night,
       Before he came, especially at night;
     'And poor Juanna, too—the child's first night
            But the monk is lord by night;
     'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
     But bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.
       At least one of them!—Oh, the heavy night,
       Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;
     He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright
     Yet as the consequences are as bright
     By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright
       To keep our holy beacons always bright,
       For he had two, both tolerably bright,
     More evil in an hour, than thirty bright
       But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;
     And gazed around them to the left and right
     And so all ye, who would be in the right
     And that the rest had faced unto the right
     If hearts lay on the left side or the right
       Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.
     And black silk neckcloth—and replied, 'You 're right;
     What will become on 't—I 'm in such a fright,
       Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,
     I can't exactly trace their rule of right,
       To thee both oh! and ah! belong of right
       You might be sure she was a perfect fright;
     Perhaps this new position—but I 'm right;
       Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,
       His cause by leaning much from might to right:
       A quantity of palisades upright,
     Which all who saw it follow'd, wrong or right.
       I can't but say that his mamma was right,
     When it grew rather late to set things right.
       Because it makes us smile: his hero 's right,
            To question that friar's right.
     'If you are wrong, then everybody's right.'
          Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,
     With such a clamour! I had thought it right
     At least he pays no rent, and has best right
     Though certes by no means so grand a sight
       When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,
       Or old indulge man with a second sight.
     I can't but say it is an awkward sight
       Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,
     And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.
     In seeing matters which are out of sight.
     Was used—nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,
     When one is shook in sound, and one in sight;
     A Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;
       (Keeping the due proportions still in sight)
     To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,
     A devotee when soars the Host in sight,
       And the mosque crescent struggled into sight
       Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;
       She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
       Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:
     Thus the young khan, with houris in his sight,
     Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight
     I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,
     Had seen the world—which is a curious sight,
     Caesar himself, who, in the very sight
       But his adventures form a sorry sight;
     And that in his confusion he had caught
     That few or none more than himself had caught
     Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught
       Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;
       Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught
     The sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,
     In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)
     (This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,
     A sorrier still is the great moral taught
     He liked to teach that which he had been taught,
     Most proper for the Christians he had bought.
     So precious that it was not to be bought,
     She order'd him directly to be bought,
     There was no end unto the things she bought,
       And is extinguish'd sooner than she ought:
       Stopp'd for a minute, as perhaps he ought
       So let us be acquainted, as we ought:
       No Caesar, but a fine young lad, who fought
       As gallantly as ever heroes fought,
       Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.
     (This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
     And Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,
       Which even those who obey would fain be thought
     These were advantages: and then he thought—
     Which froze to marble as it fell,—she thought.
       For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought
     He chose himself to point out what he thought
     The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought
     By that real epic unto all who have thought.
     And swimming long in the abyss of thought
       You never could divine his real thought;
     They will destroy a face which mortal thought
       Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;
     More than can be believed, or even thought,
       (Start not, kind reader; since great Homer thought
       'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
       I know not what might be the lady's thought,
     The past still welcome as the present thought.
     The king himself had cheapen'd it, but thought
     I would not imitate the petty thought,

     The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought
     There was a picture-dealer who had brought

       Arising out of business, often brought
     For all the glory your conversion brought,
     Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;
       And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,
       Wondering what next, till the caique was brought

       Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.
     It might be seen, with diligence was sought,
     There was not now a luggage boy but sought
       Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;
       No matter what—it was not that they sought;
       Which piques a preux chevalier—as it ought:
       Upon her friends, as everybody ought.
     Confused, in the confusion, and distrait,
       They parted for the present—these to await,

       Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit
       His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,
       Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;
       Of a foe o'er him, snatch'd at it, and bit
       Here peals the people's voice, nor can entomb it
     And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it
     Yet they were happy,—happy in the illicit
       Before him summ'd the awful scroll and read it);
     But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.
     A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)
     Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,
     Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it—
       And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,
     Of good advice—and two or three of credit.
     Not to be overlook'd—and gave such credit,
     Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,
       He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it
     That future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.
       Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it
     And look'd as much as if to say, 'I said it;'
     And as for chastity, you 'll never bind it
     For me, I leave the matter where I find it,
     People some ten times less in fact to mind it,
     None in particular had sought or plann'd it,
     Had stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it.
     Which some supposed (though he had not avow'd it)
       A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;
     Before they find an hour to introduce it;
       And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.
       Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.
     Which means that vulgar people must not share it.
     And then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.
     A verdict—grievous foe to those who cause it!-
     As a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.
     I own no prosody can ever rate it
     Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)
     Nor, if unto the world I ever gave it,
     But such intent I never had, nor have it;
       And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,
       But do you more, Sempronius—don't deserve it,'
       Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;
     And though, as you remember, in a fit
     Such was his sovereign's pleasure (though unfit,
     Whate'er the cause, the church made little of it—
     In such guise that she could make nothing of it.

     As for his place, he could but say this of it,
     Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit

       Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it
     That he exactly the just medium hit
     They almost lost their way, and had to pick it—
     Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,
     Must breakfast—and betimes, lest they should ask it,
     While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.
     Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.
       She thought that her lord's heart (even could she claim it)
       Walk'd on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,
     Yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,
     While Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,
     And for the boat—the crew kept crowding in it.
       Contrived to get itself comprised within it.
     Without an awful wish to plunge within it.
     Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,
       I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;
     Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.
     Or can't do otherwise than lie, but do it
     If some one had not told me to forego it.
     So well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.
       Profit he care not for, let others reap it;
       And champion him to the utmost'—he would keep it,
       The country would have far more cause to weep it:
     Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.
     Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
     Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.
     Not the less precious, that we seldom hear it.
     Or how is 't matter trembles to come near it?
     And wear my head, denying that I wear it.
       And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:
     'Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit—'
     And sang with much simplicity,—a merit
       For such a shield, which leaves but little merit
     Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,
     Or adamant, to find the world a spirit,
     But then she had a devil of a spirit,
     Hero—for what is substance to a spirit?
     Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!
       Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,
     That 's your affair, not mine: a real spirit
     But he had genius,—when a turncoat has it,
     But to my subject—let me see—what was it?-
     Can't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.
       Stone-Henge is not—but what the devil is it?-
       That madmen may not bite you on a visit;
     But more imprudent grown with every visit,

     She whisper'd, in great wrath—'I must deposit
     That without notice few full moons shall pass it;
     When we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,

     Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it—
     To rise against earth's tyrants. Never let it

     With the kind world's amen—'Who would have thought it?'
     They are wrong—that 's not the way to set about it;
     But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;
       In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,
     The first thing boys like after play and fruit;
       And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit
     Lovely as those which ripen'd Eden's fruit;
       As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit
     And night is flung off like a mourning suit

     I do declare, upon an affidavit,
     If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
     Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,
     For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;
     I rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit,
       (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit
       The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:
     And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.

     Is call'd on to support his claim, or show it,
     Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,
       And for his theme—he seldom sung below it,
     Thought that it might turn out so—now I know it,
     For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.
     Even I—albeit I 'm sure I did not know it,
     You are not a moral people, and you know it
       In short, all know, or very soon may know it;
     Emasculated to the marrow, it
     To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,
       Which some call 'the sublime:' I wish they 'd try it:
       The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)
       Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt
       To the Gazette—which doubtless fairly dealt
       Which made a long debate; but I must halt,
     Which weigh'd upon them yet, all damp and salt,
     Factitious passions, wit without much salt,
     With much to excite, there 's little to exalt;
       At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt—
       For without hearts there is no home; and felt
       The blue sea's border; and I Don Juan felt—
       In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt
       There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt
       Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt
       Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,
     Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,
     He was a Greek, and on his isle had built
     For Fame 's a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.

     'Why, general, if he hath no greater fault
     Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.
     A sort of varnish over every fault;
     In war than love, he had better lead the assault.'

       Most strongly recommended an assault;

     A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot
       Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;
     His man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,
       And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,
     The breath of morn and man, where foot by foot
       With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.
     The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,
       Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,
     For ennui is a growth of English root,
       But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,
     For war cuts up not only branch, but root.
     I say I do believe a haunted spot
     Of officers a third fell on the spot,
     By Christian soldiery, a single spot
     She recognized no being, and no spot,
     Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.
       Vied with each other on this costly spot;
     Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot
     Because they can't find out the very spot
     A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.
       And the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot
     The drainer of oblivion, even the sot,
       Be such as I can properly accept;
       Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,
     Seemed pale and shivered, as if she had kept
     And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.
       A thousand warriors by his word were kept
       Speak!' but he spoke not: 'Wake!' but still he slept:—
     Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.
     A vigil or dreamt rather more than slept.

       (Mind—that I do not say—she had not slept),
     That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;
     (For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept
       As if she had just now from out them crept:
     And though it was no opiate, slumber crept
     To prayer was heard no more!—and Juan wept,
       May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt
       Thou gate of life and death—thou nondescript!
       Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript
       Replied the other, 'do not interrupt:
       Sir!—as I said, as soon as I have supt,
     O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
       Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart
       On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:—
       That hath a memory, or that had a heart?
     Of the world's stoics—men without a heart.'
     Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.
     Alas! there is no instinct like the heart—
       Corroding in the cavern of the heart,
     Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.
       A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,
     Is much in most things, not less in the heart
     A bee flew out and stung her to the heart,
     A something all-sufficient for the heart
     Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart
     Of what should be monopoly—the heart.
     Where fights not to the last some desperate heart
     A vestal shrine of innocence of heart:
     He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
     Which many people take for want of heart.
     I have no further claim on your young heart,
     Mix'd in each other's arms, and heart in heart,
     (Now here 's a word quite after my own heart,
     And first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,
     And louder than her breathing beats her heart.
     What matters if the road be head or heart?
     And, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart
     Most likely to attain her aim—his heart.
       That when the very lance was in his heart,
     Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,
     Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.
     He saw increasing on his father's heart,
     How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart
       And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,
     The cutting off his head was not the art
     A courier on the spur inspired new heart
     Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
     No more—no more—Oh! never more, my heart,
     Self-love in man, too, beats all female art;
     Whene'er he can; for there is little art
     Here War forgot his own destructive art
     A thing of temperament and not of art,
     War 's a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,
     Frail mariners afloat without a chart,
       Such are—but I have lost the London Chart.
     To feel for none is the true social art
     Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,
     The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;
     Of truth than prose, unless to suit the mart
     Small is the rest of those who would be smart,
       And turning human nature to an art.
       These last had disappear'd—a loss to art:
     Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;
     Its snow through all;—her soft lips lie apart,
       (While yet the church was Rome's) stood half apart
     'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
     Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
     The politicians, in a nook apart,
     She call'd her husband now and then apart,
     Or death of those we dote on, when a part
     When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;
     Would wither less than these two torn apart;
       With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,
       For reasons which I choose to keep apart.
       Dissimulation always sets apart
     Felt as if never more to beat apart.
     If that politeness set it not apart;
       Pars parva fui,' but still art and part.
       Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.
     'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
     But then the fact 's a fact—and 't is the part
     Which form an ornament, but no more part
     She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part
       Upon them, ne'ertheless had reach'd the rampart,
     Reach'd the interior talus of the rampart.
     If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,
     So that if any actor miss'd his part
     If you have acted once a generous part,
     But how to fill up that same vacant part?
     How self-deceitful is the sagest part
     With the deep deadly thought that they must part.
     The city 's taken—only part by part—
     But on the thirteenth, when already part
     That 's noble! That 's romantic! For my part,
     So well she acted all and every part
     The wits watch'd every loophole for their art,
     The world was not for them, nor the world's art
     As well as dilettanti in war's art,
     For her Feinagle's were an useless art,
     Lord Henry heard her plans of artless art
     Beyond the best apothecary's art,
     And so—she awoke with a great scream and start.
     As the far bell of vesper makes him start,
     You are 'the best of cut-throats:'—do not start;
     In safety to the place for which you start,
     The illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art
     To love too much has been the only art
     Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art
     But, light and airy, stood on the alert,
     Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,
     Exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,
     (But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
     Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;
     If any person should presume to assert
     By humouring always what they might assert,
     For the man was, we safely may assert,
     Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,
     For deeming human clay but common dirt,
     Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt
     Whatever feeling shook her, it seem'd short,
       The middle-aged to make the day more short;
     But no one dreams of ever being short.-
     It was but a convulsion, which though short
     I think that several volumes would fall short,
     And, going down head foremost—sunk, in short.
     Lolah, Katinka, and Dudu; in short
       All cars, though long; all ages, though so short,
     I meant to make this poem very short,
     And some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'
     'If' (says the historian here) 'I could report
     Were they, according to the best report,
     His Highness was a man of solemn port,
     She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,
       Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport—
     When Juan spoke, too—it might be in sport—
     Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;
     He was as good a sovereign of the sort
       Arms to which men will never more resort,
     Although she was not of the fainting sort,
     Of those who had most genius for this sort
     She turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort
       Though nameless in our language:—we retort

     No doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court

       Of Cossacques and their prey, turn'd round and cast
     Paused for a moment, from the fight, and cast
       Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,
     Just as my great coat was about me cast,
     He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast
     For some few years his lot had been o'ercast
       'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;
     And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,
     Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast
     The very instant, till the change that cast
       In such sort, that the eye along it cast
     In brief, the little orphan of the East
       An outline of the customs of the East,
       Exacted by the customs of the East,
     That I dissert, like grace before a feast:
       That they were going to a marriage feast
     Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast
       (For they themselves will be but of the least:
       Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,
       He drank six cups of coffee at the least,
     The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,
       The gender still was epicene, at least
       Since there is discord after both at least):
     O, pardon my digression—or at least
     As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,
       A child the moment when it drains the breast,
     May win perhaps a riband at the breast!
     Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,
     And hide her little palpitating breast
     Except itself;—such is the human breast;
     Already many a once love-beaten breast
     And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,
     Upon her mind; the more so, as her breast
       And hid her face within Juanna's breast:
     Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast
     And here he was—who upon woman's breast,
     Thou bring'st the child, too, to the mother's breast.
       Hush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,
           Earth! render back from out thy breast
       Pillow'd upon a fair and happy breast,
       Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,
       How the new worldlings of the then new East
     But now it flow'd in natural and fast,
       Object on object flash'd so bright and fast;
       Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast:
     Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,
     Look back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast
     She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,
     But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,
     And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,
       We know not this—the blood flows on too fast;
       There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
     She held their old faith and old feelings fast.
     What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast
     The good old gentleman was quite aghast,
     But I must do my duty—how thou hast
     Repented all his sins, and made a last
       Sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,
     A glance on that slain son, his first and last.
       Into a room still nobler than the last;
     But still 't is best to struggle to the last,
     To novel power; and as she was the last,
       'Whence come ye?'—'From Constantinople last,
     Like a rich wreck—her first love, and her last.
       Being tired in time, and, neither least nor last,
     But time, the comforter, will come at last;
     To deem the woods shall be our home at last
     When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,
       And sharp Adversity, will teach at last
       Own they foresaw that you would fall at last,
       And look'd upon it long, and when at last
     An Eastern anti-jacobin at last
     And then her sex's shame broke in at last,
       In small fine China cups, came in at last;
     Twelve days and nights she wither'd thus; at last,
     I say at first—for he found out at last,
       When, being made her property at last,
     The other evening ('t was on Friday last)—
     But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,
       Kept above water, with an oar for mast,
     Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),
     For there one learns—'t is not for me to boast,
     Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
     Have you explored the limits of the coast,
       Was just describing—Yes, it was the coast—
     It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,
     The land appear'd a high and rocky coast,
       Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
       The morning came, and breakfast, tea and toast,
     I heard a shot—'t was eight o'clock scarce past—
     He praised the present, and abused the past,
     And pondering on the present and the past,
       Utter'd by friends, those prophets of the past,
     Done thine, the present vouches for the past.
       And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,
       Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,
     When, where, and how he chose for that repast.
     Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)
     A parting pang, the spirit from her past:
     Under the vessel's keel the sail was past,
       Amongst live poets and blue ladies, past
       She now conceived all difficulties past,
       That neither of their intellects are vast:
       And every couch is occupied; you had best
       Adding, that this was commonest and best,
     Herself that her intentions were the best,
       And certainly this course was much the best:
       Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best
     And so I interfered, and with the best
       Or loved, it was with what we call 'the best
       But no doubt every thing is for the best—
       Or even mere fashion, which indeed 's the best
       Twin opposites, the second is the best.
     Be too minute; an outline is the best,—
     And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:
     But seize the last word, which no doubt 's the best.
       Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:
       I 'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best:
     Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best
     Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;
     But don't pretend to settle which was best.
     'What friar?' said Juan; and he did his best
     We know where things and men must end at best:
     Our veins, when things call'd sovereigns think it best
     And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best
     Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;—
     And also could you look a little modest,
     The man in all the rest might be confest,
     The only truth that yet has been confest
       A miser filling his most hoarded chest,
     A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,
     Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:—
     Against all evil speaking, even in jest.
     To kill, and generals turn it into jest.
       Or none at all—which seems a sorry jest:
           Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.'
           Must we but weep o'er days more blest?
       And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest
       (Such, early traveller! is the truth thou learnest)—
       A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.
       The next of perils, though I place it sternest,
     But soon they grow again and leave their nest.
       To see her bird reposing in his nest;
       Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;
     Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.
       The fair czarina's autocratic crest,
       Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.
       A half-way house of diplomatic rest,
       And some who had but talent for their crest;
     I don't know whether they had arms or crest,
       The colour of a budding rose's crest.
     Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,
     Recommendation; and to be well drest
     The night was as before: he was undrest,
     But so far like a lady, that 't was drest
     And false—though true; for surely they 're sincerest
     Will very often supersede the rest.
     Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest
     'But your own feelings. Even should all the rest
     Jack Thomson and Bill Thomson; all the rest
       Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,
     A lively reader's fancy does the rest.
       Which,—taken at the flood,'—you know the rest,
     Now when she once had ta'en an interest
       For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest—
     Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,
     Making the countenance a masque of rest,
     Are gather'd round us by thy look of rest;
       Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,
       With, 'Ladies, it is time to go to rest.
     But all are better than the sigh supprest,
     Yet let them think that Horace has exprest
       And Juan now his willingness exprest
     And thus in every look she saw exprest
       The mystery of this rupture of their rest;
     'You look,' quoth he, 'as if you had had your rest
     Pinions to flee away, and be at rest!'
       Lull'd like the depth of ocean when at rest,
     To place him in the cave for present rest:
     I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest—
     Amidst the bodies lull'd in bloody rest.
       The kindest may be taken as a test.
     And he could even withstand that awkward test
     I hate inconstancy—I loathe, detest,
     When some smart talker puts them to the test,
       To be produced when brought up to the test.
     But scandal 's my aversion—I protest
       For she had seen the world and stood its test,
       Of such discussion. She was there a guest;
       An Arab with a stranger for a guest,
       Was Juan a recherche, welcome guest,
       Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,
     But apprehensive of his spectral guest,
     You love this boyish, new, seraglio guest,
     Even were St. Francis' paramour their guest,
     Their charity increased about their guest;
     Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,
       Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,
       She added to Juanna, their new guest:
       For one or two days, reader, we request
       Is no great matter, so 't is in request,
     I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.
     Whereon immediately at his request
       Off each attack, when people are in quest
     And that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest
     No real likeness,—like the old Tyrian vest
     Completely 'sans culotte,' and without vest;
           To sounds which echo further west
     Superbly, and contain'd a world of zest.
     Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;
     The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist
     First knocks were heard, then 'Madam—Madam—hist!
     A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;
     And added greatly to the missing list.
       Prepared each morn for evenings. 'List, oh, list!'-
     Sooner 'come lace into the civil list
       In England ranks quite on a different list
     But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
       Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,
       Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.
     And then held out his jugular and wrist.
       That Juan was unlikely to resist
       Both to the duchess and diplomatist,
     But should the day come when place ceased to exist,
     Such love is innocent, and may exist
       The company, whose birth, wealth, worth have cost
     And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
       Denying the receipt of what it cost,
       Assembled with our hostess and mine host.
     Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?
     I said it was a story of a ghost—
       That he the night before had seen a ghost,
       In making him as silent as a ghost,
     Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,
     Delighted with their dinner and their host,
       And baffled the assaults of all their host;
     Deck'd by the rays reflected from his host,
     Set by a current, toward it: they were lost
     As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
     'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
     And don't regret the time you may have lost,
     All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,
     (A chance still), 't is a voyage or vessel lost.
       If yet the city's rest were won or lost;
       In him some feelings he had lately lost,
     But of all truths which she has told, the most
     But with the Lady Adeline the most.
       He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.
       That one scarce knew at what to marvel most
     Which those most swear to who believe them most)—
     I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,
     And do not think I mean to sneer at most
     As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most
       Who thank'd me duly by return of post—
     And thus we see—who doubts the Morning Post?
     And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.
       Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:
     He owed to an old woman and his post.
       And dolphin's leap, and little billow crost
     For if the Pole 's not open, but all frost
     To what part of the earth they had been tost,
       The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,
     A better welcome to the tempest-tost;
     Of Doctors' Commons: but she dreaded first
CANTO THE FIRST
     Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first
     But to continue:—I say not the first,
     Among the first,—I will not say the first,
       Was made with all alacrity: the first
       Was, for the elder and the stouter, first
       Was also in three columns, with a thirst
     To him, and I should hope to most. The thirst
     These quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst—
     It was not that she fear'd the very worst:
       And trousers not so tight that they would burst,
       And waited but the signal's voice to burst
     And was not likely all at once to burst
     Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst
     And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.
     Glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,
     The Briton must be bold who really durst
       A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst,
     That famish'd people must be slowly nurst,
     And this omission, like that of the bust
     There was an Irish lady, to whose bust
     A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.
     It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,
       In aspect, plainly clad, besmear'd with dust,
     And the two are so mix'd with human dust,
       Who would as 't were identify their dust
     No doubt a consolation to his dust.
     To have, when the original is dust,
     To hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.
     When Adeline replied with some disgust,
     'T is not mere splendour makes the show august
     With one or two small senses added, just
       Those holier mysteries which the wise and just
       Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'-
     But now it seems he's right, his notion just,
     They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,
     I 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just
       Less than their grief (and truly not less just)
     Over their idol, till some wealthier lust
     Juan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;—
       And love of glory 's but an airy lust,
     A frequent model; and if e'er she must
     Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.
     He will forgive himself;—if not, I must.
     He found, as people on most trials must,
       Believe:—if 't is improbable you must,
     Well, we won't analyse—our story must
     And Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust
       Look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust
     However, I forgive him, and I trust
       'T is always best to take things upon trust.
     Awaits them, treachery is all their trust;
     To eye or heart—it is the people's trust.
     Strange too in my 'buon camerado' Scott,
     So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:
     With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.
     Haidee and Juan were not married, but
     For my part I say nothing—nothing—but
       To hear new words, and to repeat them; but
     The second had his cheek laid open; but
     And, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but
       Which was a mixture of all metals, but
       To take some trouble with his toilet, but
     I should be loth to march without you, but,
     She was not violently lively, but
     At last they did get at it really, but
       His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,
     By God! we 'll be too late for the first cut.'
     She look'd (this simile 's quite new) just cut
     The very shadow of true Truth would shut
     'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
     'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
       Were such as could not in his breast be shut
     Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,
     Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut
       This long parenthesis: I could not shut
     I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talk'd about—
     But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk'd about;
     And several of her best bon-mots were hawk'd about:
       They knew not where nor what they were about;
       Of Titans, giants, fellows of about
     Without their seeing what he was about.
     And dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,
     Till all the arts at length are brought about,
     Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,

       Lord Henry was a justice, and that Scout

     Begg'd to bring up the little girl and 'out,'-
       With the same thought the two words have help'd out:
     It seems when this allotment was made out,
     And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.
     Until at length the smother'd fire broke out,
     He had the art of drawing people out,
       But not with violence; the stars shone out,
       Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,
     In soups or sauces, or a sole ragout,
       From nature for the service of the gout—
     Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.
       Unto the new creation, rising out
       Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:

     I think I can explain myself without
       'T was not her fortune—he has enough without:
     How power could condescend to do without.
     And one or two sad, separate wives, without
       And marriage also may exist without;
     But by the mass who go below without
     This—when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.
     Which never meets, and therefore can't fall out.
     Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;
     Must not have latterly been quite worn out,
     Must be declined, while life's thin thread 's spun out
       Of reformation, ere the year run out,
     That monstrous hieroglyphic—that long spout
     Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,
       That fever which precedes the languid rout
       One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;
       As I 'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:
     But, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'
     Or—what is just the same—it wearies out.
     'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'

     The blows upon his cutlass, and then put

     Historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put

       Aside his very mirror soon was put;
     One gang of people instantly was put

     They write, and for what end; but, note or text,

     A kind of sleepy Venus seem'd Dudu,
       And I shall place Juanna with Dudu,
     Then out it came at length, that to Dudu
       And thus my narrative proceeds:—Dudu,
     And I must even survive this last adieu,
       Here is the garden-key—Fly—fly—Adieu!
     Which charm'd the charming Mary Montagu.
     All sounds it pierceth 'Allah! Allah! Hu!'
     An earthly paradise of 'Or Molu.'
       To hail her with the apostrophe—'O thou!'
           And where are they? and where art thou,
       Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;
     The only gentlemen seem I and you;
     The dame replied, 'Between your dreams and you,
     Why, I 'm posterity—and so are you;
     That killing him is not the way to cure you.'
     O, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!
     Excuse my freedom, when I here assure you,

     And I, ye learned ladies, say of you;

       In honest simple verse this song to you.
            And he 'll say nought to you;
       Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you
       My own merits, and though young—I see, Sir—you

     That hour is not for us, but 't is for you:
     And bear with life, to love and pray for you!'
     She has served me also much the same as you,
     Must be believed, though they believe not you,
     Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,
     But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.
     The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,
       Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,
     For I have found it answer—so may you.

        But not to go too far, I hold it law
       And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,

       And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,

     The Lady Adeline, as soon 's she saw
       All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw

     Not I have made this desolation: few
       And then they were too many, though so few—
     Where his assets were waxing rather few,
     I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.
     To whom he spoke, and made his words but few.

     Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,

       An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;
       Upon the metamorphosis in view,—
     Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.
       And starting, she awoke, and what to view?
       Perforce, since whatsoever met her view

     Again the weather threaten'd,—again blew
       So changeable had been the winds that blew;
       Than what it had been, for so strong it blew
     His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew
       And Julia instant to the closet flew.
       Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
       The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.
     Touch'd by the heroism of him they slew,
       Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;
       Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
       With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:
     My gentle countrymen, we will renew
     Begot—but that 's to come—Well, to renew:
     And though at first their strength it might renew,
       Of the apartment—and appear'd quite new;
       Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,
       How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),
       Whom a good mien, especially if new,
       Change grows too changeable, without being new:
       Rather the dead, for life seem'd something new,
       Faded, or alter'd into something new—
     Except that I have found it nothing new.'
       Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.
     This dialogue; for he who answer'd knew
     When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew
     Water appear'd; yet, though the people knew
       In various conjectures, for none knew
     I love him—I will die with him: I knew
       His own remonstrance further he well knew
     Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew
     And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,
       Say seven-and-twenty; for I never knew
     Mischief in families, as some know or knew,
     But when the offer went beyond, they knew
     And even those were nearer than they knew.
     She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,
     In the fair form of their companion new,
     To me this kind of life is not so new;
     To be disposed of in a way so new,
       Especially when life is rather new:
     Whose young, unwaken'd world was ever new,
     But certain 'tis they all felt for their new
       When nothing shall be either old or new.
       Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.
       But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new,
     The scars of his old wounds were near his new,
       Love is so very timid when 't is new:
       To whom the opera is by no means new:
     To mend his former morals, and get new,
     The oldest thing on record, and yet new!
       And pass, for want of better, though not new:
     You mean our master—not the old, but new.'
       Than witches, b—ches, or physicians, brew.
     He paused—and so will I; as doth a crew
     'Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;
       And in them crowded several of the crew;
       Was interrupted by the pirate crew,
     They form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,
       And Aristippus, a material crew!
     But what was strangest in this virgin crew,
       Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew;
     And thus it was with this our hapless crew;
       Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;
     'My boy!' said he, 'amidst this motley crew
     There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,
     Farewell, too, dearest Julia!—(Here he drew
     There was awe in the homage which she drew;
     She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.
     'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
     Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew
     The father paused a moment, then withdrew
       And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
     For, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew
     Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,
       And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,
     And watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew
       And higher grew the mountains as they drew,
     Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.
     As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,
     And in the midst a golden apple grew,—
       Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew
     He was not all alone: around him grew
     And then into a hoarser murmur grew,
       Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?
       Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
       More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew—
       Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
     His sons were kept in prison, till they grew
     For shore it was, and gradually grew
     Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw
       Thinking unutterable things; he threw
     Rather too high and distant; that she threw
       The captives back to their sad berths; each threw
     His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw
       She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw
     Something imperial, or imperious, threw
     According as the skies their shadows threw.
     She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw
       Differ, except in robbing with a bow,
     And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,
     To pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;
     Katinka, too; and with a gentle bow
       For I have drawn much less with a long bow
     Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,
     His answers with a very graceful bow,
     Graceful as Dian, when she draws her bow,
       Ismail 's no more! The crescent's silver bow
     Is idle; let us like most others bow,
       And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
     With fascination in his very bow,
       The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
       And God knows who besides in 'au' and 'ow,'
     Kept up; and above all, the where and how
       He was well lodged, but only wonder'd how
       Said Juan; 'but I really don't see how
       Especially of war and taxing,—how,
       Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,
     What, after all, are all things—but a show?
       Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show
       And you an equal courtesy should show.'
       A thing, of which similitudes can show
       And all her points as thorough-bred to show:
       The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show
     She took Juanna by the hand to show
       Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show
     What pedigree the best would have to show?
     Who name the French in English, save to show
       The little I have said may serve to show
       She drew up to her height, as if to show
     Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
       O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show
     Apart from one who had no sin to show,
       The gentlemen that were the first to show
     In begging him, for God's sake, just to show
       For out of these three 'preux Chevaliers,' how
     Who have imputed such designs as show
     And what is that? Devotion, doubtless—how
       For both sides I could many reasons show,
     Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show
     Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,
     And she would have consoled, but knew not how:
       So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how;
       I was most ready to return a blow,
     With him it never was a word and blow,
     Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
       Pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo'd the blow;
       And none liked to anticipate the blow;
     How eager all the earth is for the blow
       As if she had received a sudden blow,
     With twilight it again came on to blow,
     For the sky show'd it would come on to blow,
     On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow—
     With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,
       The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low
     They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
     Pointed to Juan who remain'd below.
     To supersede all warblers here below,
     And walking out upon the beach, below
       But let us die like men, not sink below
     A portion of their beef up from below,
     Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.
       Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)
     Think of the Thunderer's falling down below
       To make such puppets of us things below),
     Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?
       Flame was shower'd forth above, as well 's below,
       And for the fame you would engross below,
     Young innate feelings all have felt below,
           And ships, by thousands, lay below,
       Withal: it lies perhaps a little low,
     And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;
     Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.
     The blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow
       Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,
     Of life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,
       But red with no redeeming gore: the glow
     They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow
     Of her deep purple robe, and speaking low,
       And see a sentimental passion glow,
     Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,
     My bosom underwent a glorious glow,
       Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,
     Mounting at times to a transparent glow,
       Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow.
     In the chill dark, when courage does not glow
       Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;
       Like Arno in the summer, to a shallow,
       Mix'd Gothic, such as artists all allow
       That being about the number I 'll allow
       All who have loved, or love, will still allow
       As clear as such a climate will allow;
       'No?' quoth the other; 'yet you will allow
       But what is to be done? I can't allow
       'Twas foolish, nervous, as she must allow,
       There 's fortune even in fame, we must allow.
     And yet, like all men else, I must allow,
     Death 's a reformer, all men must allow.
       All very accurate, you must allow,
       Yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow
       And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;
     As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,
       All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,
       An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;
       In company a very pleasant fellow,
     In short, he was a very pretty fellow,
       Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,
     They took it up when my days grew more mellow,
       Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;
     Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,
       Which threatens inundations deep and yellow!
     Now my sere fancy 'falls into the yellow
       She wore two jelicks—one was of pale yellow;
     As what is lost in green is gain'd in yellow.
     Although his woes had turn'd him rather yellow.
       Stirr'd up and down her bosom like a billow,
     Regaled two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow—
       'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;
       Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,
       His headache being increased by every billow;
       Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,
       For contemplation rather than his pillow:
       But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,
       Below his window waved (of course) a willow;
       Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,
     They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,
     The boat made way; yet now they were so low,
     Of one good man, with stately march and slow,
     Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,
       Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,
       Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low
     Were damnably mistaken; few are slow
       Reserve and pride could make him, and full slow
     Who never found a single hour too slow,
       For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,
       The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
     Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
       For laughter—but she felt her spirits low,
       If I might augur, I should rate but low
       In this anatomy, I 've finish'd now
       Where all sighs are deposited; and now
       An old, old monastery once, and now
     But coughs will come when sighs depart—and now
       Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:
     There, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)
       Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now,
     O, thou eternal Homer! I have now
       As the first Canto promised. You have now
       That such existed? (and they may live now
     The ship was evidently settling now
     O reader! if that thou canst read,—and know,
     Were French, and famous people, as we know:
       Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know
     But when you have supposed the few we know,
     'Where will you serve?'—'Where'er you please.'—'I know
     I never married—but, I think, I know
     And though so much inferior, as I know,
       Or none; or like—like nothing that I know

     All generations, I should like to know
     To laugh at all things—for I wish to know
     O, gentle ladies! should you seek to know
     Which the mere passionless can never know.
       I do not know you, and may never know
     Tormented with a wound he could not know,
       And they who watch'd her nearest could not know
     How I have treated it, I do not know;
     Here Lolah interposed—'Mamma, you know
     But being naked, she was shock'd, you know,
     'Jest!' quoth Milor; 'why, Adeline, you know
       That cocking of a pistol, when you know
     You, Bob, are rather insolent, you know,

       'I did.'—'What next?'—'I really hardly know.'
       Their own true interests, which kings rarely know
     Alas! could she but fully, truly, know

     Said, 'In Heaven's name let's get some supper now,

       At least to dream so loudly as just now;
     And wherefore this exordium?—Why, just now,
       And tenderness, and infancy; but now
       To welcome foreigners in this way: now
       Were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!),
       And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;
       Have not been troubled with them lately. Now

     And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'
     Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
       Pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,
     Though modest, on his unembarrass'd brow
       And Love 's a god, or was before the brow
     Will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow

           A king sate on the rocky brow
     You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.
       So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:
     The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow

     Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow;
     Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow

       These phrases of refinement I must borrow

     No more of them, than they of her, I trow.

       And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,
       Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow:
     But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
     Some went to prayers again, and made a vow
     Not as they ought to be: for I avow,

       And deaf, that any other it would vex,
       Although her beauty was enough to vex,

     They only add them all in an appendix,

     A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.
     Besides, he had some qualities which fix

     But I 'm not OEdipus, and life 's a Sphinx.
     Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.
     By borrowing a new one from an ox.
     With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
       Relieved with 'dindon a la Parigeux;'
     Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;
     And the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,
     Materials as were cast up round the bay,—
     A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,
     The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,
     A long and snake-like life of dull decay
       Seeming to weep the dying day's decay;
       And must have meals, at least one meal a day;
     Was but a moment's act.—Ah! well-a-day!
     I 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.
       Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
     And such an end! that he who many a day
     But 't was a public feast and public day,—
     And prudently postpone, until mid-day,
            He abideth night and day.
       For little had he wander'd since the day
     But seeing, flashing forward, like the day
     Dully past o'er the dinner of the day;
     Amongst the higher spirits of the day,
     As the mere pastime of an idle day,
     Was not for them—they had too little day.
       For cousins also, answer'd the same day.
     He 'll find it rather difficult some day
       My guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day.
           He counted them at break of day—
     Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,
       Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
       A purple hectic play'd like dying day
     I cried upon my first wife's dying day,
     A thing which happens everywhere each day—
       Did not his deeds unriddle them each day—
     The web of these tarantulas each day
     A sleep without dreams, after a rough day
     He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;
       Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,
     And when upon a silent, sullen day,
     The long year link'd with heavy day on day,
     Look yes last night, and yet say no to-day?
     'Departure, for his country seat, to-day,
     I thought of a peruke the other day)—
     Which charm most people in their earlier day:
       Were shaken down, and 'dogs had had their day,'
       However dear or cherish'd in their day;
     Which stiffen'd heaven) as if he wish'd for day;—
     And Time had nothing more of night nor day
       And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,
       But saddens more by night as well as day,
     An independent being in his day—
       All that the Russians did upon this day,
     It was upon a day, a summer's day.—
       Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,
     Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;
     The evaporation of a joyous day
     Of his own country;—seldom since that day
       So little they expected him that day;
       Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.
     Infants of three years old were taught that day,
       And never had as yet a quiet day
       Which portions out upon the judgment day
       Of those who sail the seas, on the first day
       That they should all be shot on the next day;
     His services. He kiss'd hands the next day,
     The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
     He left his ship to be hove down next day,
          Amundeville is lord by day,
            Though he is not seen by day.
     Where I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'
       Just as I make my mind up everyday
     To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.
     Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:
     Seem at the same time mystical and gay.
       That ladies in their youth a little gay,
       That this is not a moral tale, though gay;
     His tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,
     The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;
       Smooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay
       To-morrow sees another race as gay
       A blessing is sound sleep—Juanna lay
     The boy expired—the father held the clay,
       Baptize posterity, or future clay,—
            And he did not seem form'd of clay,
     As fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.
     To gaze once more on the commanding clay
     The precious porcelain of human clay,
       And nothing outward tells of human clay;
     The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!
       Our little selves re-form'd in finer clay,
     O'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,
     Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
     How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!
       Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,
       'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:
     In this imperial hall, at distance lay
     And there he went ashore without delay,
     I write what 's uppermost, without delay:
       Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,—
       Gentle, but without memory she lay;
            Whoever may be the lay.
     Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,
       Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay
     Here laws are all inviolate; none lay
     Upon a taken bastion, where there lay
       At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
       'T was something calculated to allay
     The main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay
     But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay
     How long in his damp trance young Juan lay
     Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay
       An end to answer, or a plan to lay—
            To turn church lands to lay,
     Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.
       'Life 's a poor player,'—then 'play out the play,
     But I 'm too late, and therefore must make play.
     As touch'd, and plaintively began to play
       But no device could be brought into play—
       And fortune, has an awkward part to play;
     For naughty children, who would rather play
     Say something to the purpose, and display
     This secret charge on Juan, to display
     Would now and then as 't were without display,
     Till slowly charged with thunder they display
       In the seraglio, where the ladies lay
       Within a cable's length their vessels lay
       March'd forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,—
       Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:
     Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,
     The voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay
     His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,
     A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
     Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay
       That ye are dogs—your betters far—ye may
     And so is spring about the end of May;
       And so for one will I, as well I may.
     I shall perpend if your proposal may
       Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;
     But pity him I neither must nor may
     And shudder;—while, as beautiful as May,
     Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,
       To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;
     John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,
     'Twas the boy's 'mite,' and, like the 'widow's,' may
     And let the Babel round run as it may,
     And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,
            Their walls, if they said nay;
     Humanity would rise, and thunder 'Nay!'
     'Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay
       Such as the conqueror William did repay
     No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.
       Are worse than the worst damages men pay
     Which I found very troublesome to pay.
     Were hardly rude enough to earn their pay:
     Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,

     The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,
     The sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.
     Must come? Much rather should he court the ray,
       Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray
     Though knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,
     Those who dislike to look upon a fray,
       To some distinguish'd strangers in that fray;
       In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray
     The air of ''T was a Friar of Orders Gray.'
     And the sky shows that very ancient gray,
     That howsoever people fast and pray,
       Could turn their optics to the text and pray,
       This story is not moral, first, I pray,
     To his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,
     To Juan, who though not much used to pray,
     But set those persons down with me to pray,
       And his black curls were dewy with the spray,
       To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,
     And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray
     When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,
     Or like a soda bottle when its spray
     'Cut off a thousand heads, before-'—'Now, pray,'
       To wield them in their terrible array.
     Of human hearts, than all the long array
       With all the damsels in their long array,
       In all the flashing of their full array;
       At the given signal join'd to their array;
     A rich confusion form'd a disarray
     The world gave ground before her bright array;
     Her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,
       And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,
     If 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,
     Of truth;—such truths are treason; they betray
       Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;
     Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,
       Of the sad consequence of going astray,
     Was wont to boast—as if a glutton's tray
     French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,
       A jurymast or rudder, or could say
       These don't express one half what I should say:
       Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say
     And truant husband should return, and say,
     To fly from, malgre all which people say
     Milton 's the prince of poets—so we say;
     To think of, if I ever think—I say
     (To my misfortune), never can I say
     Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say
       In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say
     But what 's this to the purpose? you will say.
       For Haidee's sake, is more than I can say,
     Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,
     You put me out in what I had to say.
     Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,
     He had been hid—I don't pretend to say
       And eating ices, were o'erheard to say,
            It is not mine to say;
       No stone is there to show, no tongue to say
     (No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
     (Of which I might have a good deal to say,
       And I should still have many things to say;'
     As for the ladies, I have nought to say,
       I have forgotten what I meant to say,
       (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say
     Here ends this canto.—Need I sing, or say,
       Whose merit none enough can sing or say,
     I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,
     Which show'd such deference to what females say,
       Or better, as the best examples say:
       How we won't mention, why we need not say:
       And then he added, that he needs must say,
     'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
     'Is it,' exclaim'd Gulbeyaz, 'as you say?

     A priest the other—at least so they say:
     The population there so spreads, they say
       The more 's the reason why you ought to stay.
     Raise but an arm! 't will brush their web away,
     As morning broke, the light wind died away,
     But that, like other things, has pass'd away,
     And how this heavy faintness pass'd away
       Its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;
     'My dear, I was the first who came away.'
       But went to heaven in as sincere a way
     She kept her counsel in so close a way.
     Could hardly carry anything away,
     Yet for all that keep not too long away,
     He watch'd it wistfully, until away
       Without their will, they carried them away;
     And also when my second ran away:
            Would not be driven away.
     Yet for all this he did not run away.
       For want of facts would all be thrown away),
       Certes it would have been but thrown away,
       In holy matrimony snores away.
       Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;
       The moment he has sent his fools away.
     In the mean time, to pass her hours away,
     Thus would he while his lonely hours away
       And Juan throttled him to get away,
     His house was sold, his servants sent away,
     Immediately the masts were cut away,
     'T is only that they love to throw away
     Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;
       Sees half the business in a wicked way
     At once without instalments (an old way
     With this encouragement, he led the way
     O Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,
     A door that's in or boudoir out of the way,
     To ask him awkward questions on the way
     With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,
       Yet he could not at times keep, by the way
     The merchandise was served in the same way,
     So Catherine, who had a handsome way
       Perceiving fie was in a handsome way

       And then his only garment quite gave way;
     To answer Ribas' summons to give way.

     As they were plodding on their winding way
       To breathe destruction on its winding way,
       Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,
     But Juan had a sort of winning way,
     Assume, then leave us on our freezing way.
       Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:
       Of ladies who can not have their own way;
       The Russ flotilla getting under way;
     Juan embark'd—the ship got under way,
       Their tumble, I should turn the other way,
       Gave light enough to hint their farther way,
       If they would but pursue the proper way
      We little people in our lesser way
     Of murder'd women, who had found their way
       And at the usual signal ta'en their way
       Of any slight temptation in their way;
       But should we wish to warm us on our way
     Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
     Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;
     Who favours what she should not, found his way,
       Johnson, who really loved him in his way,
     Suggested some slight comfort in his way:
       Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way
     Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,
     To hint that he is coming up this way.'
     But, his life falling into Johnson's way,
     Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.
     Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,
            He still retains his sway,
     The spirit in the end will have its way.
     Of our sensations! What a curious way
     I heard them wish 'God with you,' save that way;—
     In my young days they lent me cash that way,
     Perhaps she did not like the quiet way
       You should be civil in a modest way:
     Five, as they might do in a modest way,
       A slight observer in a modest way),
     In virgins—always in a modest way,
     Of getting into heaven the shortest way;
     Had held till now her soft and milky way;
     But bid my women form the milky way.
     Quite in a confidential queenly way,
     Considerable talent in my way.
     For which my sole excuse is—'t is my way;
     And therefore, though 't is by no means my way
     With war, or plague, or famine, any way,
       To lean on for support in any way;
       To show ye what ye are in every way.
     She marvell'd 'what he saw in such a baby
     As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?'
       In Marinet's affair—in fact, 't was shabby,
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;
       Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;

     Her young philosopher was grown already.
     But I have spoken of all this already—
       The silvery bell rang, not for 'dinner ready,

     When Juan woke he found some good things ready,
     And when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,'
     Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,
     (And so, my sober Muse—come, let 's be steady—
       Still breaking, but with stamina so steady

     It stood embosom'd in a happy valley,
     A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,
       Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,
     Witness the lands which 'flow'd with milk and honey,'
     Seem'd taking out the sting to leave the honey.
     And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
     But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,
     And I assure you, that like virgin honey
     And as for Heaven 'Heaven being Love,' why not say honey
     All I can say is—that he had the money.
     Is free, the respiration's worth the money.
     Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).
     To this we have added since, the love of money,
     For Gothic daring shown in English money.
     Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.
     With Scio wine,—and all for love, not money.
     Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,
     And merely practised as a sea-attorney.
     But see the world is only one attorney.
     With that sublime of rascals your attorney,
     The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,
     Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.
     'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.
     I 've done to find the same throughout life's journey,

       Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,
     But now at thirty years my hair is grey
     No sinking spirits told them they grew grey,
     Except some certain portions of the prey,
     Because their thoughts had never been the prey
       But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;
       That sad inexplicable beast of prey—
       Or any interesting beast of prey,
       She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.
       Such as he thought the least given up to prey;

     Excepting the post-obits of theology.
     Some persons say that Dante meant theology
       Expended all their Eastern phraseology
     For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.
     Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
     Although my opinion may require apology,
     Were forced to make an odd sort! of apology,
       So much less fight as might form an apology

     But I being fond of true philosophy,
       Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,

     There 's nought in this bad world like sympathy:
     Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
     She merely felt a common sympathy

     We tease mild Baillie, or soft Abernethy.

       And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
     Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd—why,

     But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,
     From thee we come, to thee we go, and why
     Julia was—yet I never could see why—
     O Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why
     She saw them watch her without asking why,
       Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why
     'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'
       Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;
       That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
       Are longer lived than others,—God knows why,
       They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,
     And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,
       To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
       Much too poetical: men should know why

       His brain about the action of the sky;
     As if there were no life beneath the sky
     The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.
     Lay at this period quiet as the sky,
       As some one somewhere sings about the sky,
     There 's not a meteor in the polar sky
     There still are many rainbows in your sky,
       Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
     Upon the other, and the rosy sky,

     I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,
       Save in the breeze that came not; savagely
     Like a meek tradesman when, approaching palely,
     Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?
     I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,
     Also some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,
     But still her aspect had an air so lonely!
     She came into the cave, but it was merely
     O Love! O Glory! what are ye who fly
     When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
     If so, she would have had the strength to fly
     Which learn'd from this example not to fly
     The door flew wide,—not swiftly, but, as fly
     'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;
     Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly—

     O'er her fair front, like Morning's on a lily.
     'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'

     And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);—
     While Venus fills the heart (without heart really

     And therefore Juan now began to rally
     Stood like Caractacus in act to rally
     Johnson retired a little, just to rally
     In vain he heard the others rail or rally,
     To jest upon such themes in many a sally.
     The foremost in the charge or in the sally,
     He would not join them in a single sally.
     And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally
     With various similar remarks to tally,

     Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,
       At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;

       At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy

       Nor seem embarrass'd—quite the contrary;
       They say so (Bryant says the contrary):
       As they who print them think is necessary,
       Is 't English? No—'t is only parliamentary)
     Fit for the model of a statuary
     All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,
     An art on which the artists greatly vary,
     However, 't is expedient to be wary:
     A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
     Nor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.
     And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,
     I 'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,
       The beach which lay before him, high and dry:
     But now their eyes and also lips were dry;
     Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.
     Which the poor thing at times essay'd to dry,
       And deviate into matters rather dry.
     In love drinks all life's fountains (save tears) dry.
       On what I 've seen or ponder'd, sad or cheery;
     Seems Love turn'd a lieutenant of artillery:—
     And very handsome supernatural scenery.
     I 've got new mythological machinery,
     He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
     And how to scale a fortress—or a nunnery.
       An 'Oh!' or 'Ah!' of joy or misery,
     What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
     Graced with some merit, and with more effrontery,
     Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery
     A reel within a bottle is a mystery,
     Became a kind of fashionable mystery.
     He whose whole life has been assault and battery,
     Buzz round 'the Fortune' with their busy battery,
     I am no flatterer—you 've supp'd full of flattery:
     To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!
       Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.
     That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,
       Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,
     See nought more strange in this than t' other lottery.
     And I must say, I ne'er could see the very
     In short, upon that subject I 've some qualms very
       Because they are so;—a male Mrs. Fry,
     I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.
     And still it half calls up the realms of fairy,
     He turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,
     Then for accomplishments of chivalry,
     'Soupe a la Beauveau,' whose relief was dory,
       Achilles' self was not more grim and gory
     With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,
     And were her object only what 's call'd glory,
       But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!
     Would form a lengthy lexicon of glory,
       We left him in the focus of such glory
       He revell'd in his Ciceronian glory:
     In short, this last attack, though rich in glory,
     Relieved itself by pork, for greater glory.
     They do not much contribute to his glory.
     Sometimes calls 'murder,' and at others 'glory.'
     Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.
       And lost virginity of oratory,
       Or ladies' fancies—rather transitory
       And the sea dashes round the promontory,
     Making a signal off some promontory,
     I perch upon an humbler promontory,
       With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,
     Her charming figure and romantic history
     Therefore the present piece of natural history
     To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.
     And merely state, though not for the consistory,
     And Admiral Ribas (known in Russian story)
     And what is worse still, a much longer story:
       Who were immortal, could one tell their story?
       And so good night.—Return we to our story:
     As most essential to their hero's story,
     In a few words he told their hapless story,
     May likewise put off for a time what story
     With more ease too she 'd tell a different story.
     Read your own hearts and Ireland's present story,
     On what may suit or may not suit my story,
     Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!
     Unless it were to be a moment merry,
       Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,
     In this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry—
       Because they were constructed in a hurry;
     He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry
     We were transferr'd on board her in a hurry,
       Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,
     Peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,
       For the less cause there is for all this flurry,
     But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)
       Our old acquaintance; and at least I 'll try
     Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try
     Is much more common where the climate 's sultry.
     'His country's pride,' he came down to the country.
     Though several thousand people chose to try,
       Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
     'Would we were masters now, if but to try
       In sight, then lost amidst the forestry
     With Carlton, or with other houses? Try
       Each other; and if not, I shall not try
     Along the road, as if they went to bury
     On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!
     Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.
     Shakspeare talks of 'the herald Mercury
     Because it then received no injury
     And Mitford in the nineteenth century
       Had made more progress than for the last century.
     And then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,
       Deem this a commentator's fantasy,
     Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.
       Up annals, revelations, poesy,
     I wish to do as much by poesy.
       (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):
       And waxing chiller in her courtesy,
     Which is required by proper courtesy;
       Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
     But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,
       A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy
     Into an elegant extract (much less massy)
     And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,
     A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;
     And rash enthusiasm in good society
     He was so great a loss to good society.
     The 'passee' and the past; for good society
     And the sweet consequence of large society,
     But now being lifted into high society,
       Who wish to take the tone of their society:
     Because my business is to dress society,
       To their own hearts' most sweet society;
     But politics, and policy, and piety,
     Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,—
     And a-propos of monks, their piety
       Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,
       Amidst life's infinite variety:
     So much for Nature:—by way of variety,
     Not only for the sake of their variety,
     Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,
     Pity he loved adventurous life's variety,
     Love, war, a tempest—surely there 's variety;
     Were nothing but a moral inebriety.
     The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,
       Was to restore him to his self-propriety,
     If you have nought else, here 's at least satiety
     Cite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;
     Whether his winters be eighteen or eighty,
     Hath won the experience which is deem'd so weighty.
       Than storms it as a foe would take a city;
       Meaneth the west or worst end of a city,
       I leave it to your people of sagacity
       Will serve when there is plunder in a city;—
       It had been firmness; now 't is pertinacity:
       If such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:
     What 's this in one annihilated city,
       With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.
       A most important outwork of the city—
     He made no answer; but he took the city.
       Was left upon his way to the chief city
     Could rhyme, like Nero, o'er a burning city.
     Draperied her form with curious felicity!
     And then her dress—what beautiful simplicity
     In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
       To lose those best months in a sweaty city,
     Of homicide, but there was no solidity
     Or some contractor's personal cupidity,
     Whether it was their engineer's stupidity,
     To mend the people 's an absurdity,
       The women up, because, in sad reality,
     And almost every day, in sad reality,
       By the watchman, or some such reality,
     And knew no better in her immorality
     The trouble that they gave, their immorality,
     And 't will perplex the casuist in morality
       And makes our snow less pure than our morality;
     And as my object is morality
     Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.
     And all men like to show their hospitality
     Let none accuse Old England's hospitality—
     Who, when we come to sum up the totality
     When I call 'fading' martial immortality,
     Its quantity is but condensed to quality.
     Than to wax white—for blushes are for quality.
     To him whose breeding matches with his quality.
     To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.
       Is not a thing of that astringent quality
     I don't know that there may be much ability
     As Juan mused on mutability,
     Parading all her sensibility,
     For which most friends reserve their sensibility.
       They err—'t is merely what is call'd mobility,
       Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;
     But there 's a conversational facility,
       He almost honour'd him for his docility;
     Look'd grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,
       Or contradicted but with proud humility.
       By turns—with that vivacious versatility,
       In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,
     Of this I 'm sure at least, there 's no servility
       As sometimes happens in a great extremity;
     No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.
       A prodigy—her morning dress was dimity,
       Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,
     And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
     A garment of a mystical sublimity,
       Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;
       Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
     That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'
       A general council, in which unanimity,
     Who seem'd the cream of equanimity
     Has been declared an act of inurbanity,
       Or something which was nothing, as urbanity
     By their examples of true Christianity:
       He had behaved with courage and humanity—
     Without a friend, what were humanity,
       To play upon the surface of humanity.
     Malgé  Sir Matthew Hale's great humanity.
     And in this scene of all-confess'd inanity,
     Itself with beauty's frail inanity,
       Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?
       For saving her amidst the wild insanity
     Except where 't is a mere insanity,
     (The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').
     And that 's enough, for love is vanity,
     Ecclesiastes said, 'that all is vanity'-
     One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'
       At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.
       From their ferocities produced by vanity.
       Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.
     The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;
     The fourth at once establish'd the whole Trinity
     The first attack at once proved the Divinity
     That watery outline of eternity,
     An age may come, Font of Eternity,
     The town was enter'd. Oh eternity!-
     You might have freed fallen Europe from the unity
     A husband rather old, not much in unity
     With his young wife—a time, and opportunity.
     Never had mortal man such opportunity,
       Were well nigh over. 'T is perhaps a pity,
       Much flattery—even Voltaire's, and that 's a pity.
       Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;—
       Indicative of some surprise and pity;
     Besides (alas! his taste—forgive and pity!)
       Then she was given to charity and pity,
       'T is not address'd to you—the more 's the pity
     If here and there some transient trait of pity
       And look down on the universe with pity,—
       Half her attractions—probably from pity—
     Who has not seen it will be much to pity,
     'I see you 've bought another girl; 't is pity
     It grows an act of patriotic charity,
     The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,
     My plan (but I, if but for singularity,
     That is your present theme for popularity:
     Are saving—vice spares nothing for a rarity.
     And although here and there some glorious rarity
       The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity
       No one could envy her deserved prosperity.
     Whose fame she rather doubted with posterity,
     'Gainst you the question with posterity.
     Is the Platonic pimp of all posterity.
     Will have a firm post-obit on posterity.
     He that reserves his laurels for posterity
     But Juan also shared in her austerity,
     The Lady Adeline's serene severity
     Even Petrarch's self, if judged with due severity,
       Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.
     Some people would impose now with authority,
     He neither brook'd nor claim'd superiority.
     Men whose historical superiority
     And theirs:—without a struggle for priority,
     But Saint Augustine has the great priority,
     For that same twining 'transport and security'
     Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.
       The pleasant riddles of futurity—
     I loathe that low vice—curiosity;
       Or neither—out of curiosity.'
       And show'd but little royal curiosity:
       With more than 'Oriental scrupulosity;'
       No process proved connubial animosity;
     Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity.
     How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity
     He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;
     He knew the world, and would not see depravity
     Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,
     Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
     And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.
       Descending rather quickly the declivity,
       Sunset the time, the place the same declivity
       Where London streets ferment in full activity;
       'Midst other indications of festivity,
     And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,
     Because I hate even democratic royalty.
     When shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,
     But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,
       Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
     And you will find her sum of years in plenty.
       Remember when, though I had no great plenty
     That there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.
       'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
       I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,
     By this time;—but strike six from seven-and-twenty,
       Of thought we could but snatch a certainty,
     To some civility, to others bounty,
     Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,
       Whose sole accomplishments were quite a booty;
     O for a glass of max! We 've miss'd our booty;
     Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,
     Of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty
     My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty
     The little fellow really look'd quite hearty,
     Shade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,
     By one of these, the buffo of the party,
     The consequence is, being of no party,
     O Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty
       And that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;
     Mock tyrants, when Rome's annals wax'd but dirty.
     Their chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty
     This may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty—
     Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.
       At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,
     He died at fifty for a queen of forty;
       (I wonder what it will be like at forty?
     Became divested of his native modesty.
       Kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty,
     And some such visions cross'd her majesty,
       Whom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:
       As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?
     Its bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty
     Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,
       I said that Juan did not think them pretty
     At first he did not think the women pretty.
     That a mere Christian should be half so pretty.'
       The child 's a pretty child—a very pretty—
       She merely was deem'd amiable and witty,
       Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.
     The fate of nations;—but this Russ so witty
       By no means to be very wise or witty,
       Listening debates not very wise or witty,
       And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,
     At which your wise men sneer'd in phrases witty:
       Which was not very wise, and still less witty,
       For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;
     In royalty's vast arms he sigh d for beauty:
     Own'd to a penchant, though discreet, for beauty.
     Whate'er thou takest, spare a while poor Beauty!
     Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.
       For t' other one who promises much duty;
     And Socrates, that model of all duty,
     What though she now and then may slip from duty,
     Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,
     Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,
     But ere they could perform this pious duty,
     Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.
     Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy
     To furnish matter for some future Livy
     And being of the council call'd 'the Privy,'
     Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,
     Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.

     That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.
       The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?
     She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.
     I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz—

       With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz,

DEDICATION
     Bob Southey! You're a poet, poet laureate,
       And representative of all the race.
     Although 'tis true that you turned out a Tory at
       Last, yours has lately been a common case.
     And now my epic renegade, what are ye at
       With all the lakers, in and out of place?
     A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye
     Like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye,
     Which pye being opened they began to sing'
       (This old song and new simile holds good),
     'A dainty dish to set before the King'
       Or Regent, who admires such kind of food.
     And Coleridge too has lately taken wing,
       But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,
     Explaining metaphysics to the nation.
     I wish he would explain his explanation.
     You, Bob, are rather insolent, you know,
       At being disappointed in your wish
     To supersede all warblers here below,
       And be the only blackbird in the dish.
     And then you overstrain yourself, or so,
       And tumble downward like the flying fish
     Gasping on deck, because you soar too high,
     Bob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob.
     And Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion
       (I think the quarto holds five hundred pages)
     Has given a sample from the vasty version
       Of his new system to perplex the sages.
     'Tis poetry, at least by his assertion,
       And may appear so when the Dog Star rages,
     And he who understands it would be able
     To add a story to the tower of Babel.
     You gentlemen, by dint of long seclusion
       From better company, have kept your own
     At Keswick, and through still continued fusion
       Of one another's minds at last have grown
     To deem, as a most logical conclusion,
       That poesy has wreaths for you alone.
     There is a narrowness in such a notion,
     Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for ocean.
     I would not imitate the petty thought,
       Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,
     For all the glory your conversion brought,
       Since gold alone should not have been its price.
     You have your salary; was't for that you wrought?
       And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.
     You're shabby fellows—true—but poets still
     And duly seated on the immortal hill.
     Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows,
       Perhaps some virtuous blushes; let them go.
     To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs,
       And for the fame you would engross below,
     The field is universal and allows
       Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow.
     Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try
     'Gainst you the question with posterity.
     For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,
       Contend not with you on the winged' steed,
     I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,
       The fame you envy and the skill you need.
     And recollect a poet nothing loses
       In giving to his brethren their full meed
     Of merit, and complaint of present days
     Is not the certain path to future praise.
     He that reserves his laurels for posterity
       (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)
     Has generally no great crop to spare it, he
       Being only injured by his own assertion.
     And although here and there some glorious rarity
       Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,
     The major part of such appellants go
     To—God knows where—for no one else can know.
     If fallen in evil days on evil tongues,
       Milton appealed to the avenger, Time,
     If Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs
       And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,
     He deigned not to belie his soul in songs,
       Nor turn his very talent to a crime.
     He did not loathe the sire to laud the son,
     But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.
     Think'st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise
       Like Samuel from the grave to freeze once more
     The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,
        Or be alive again—again all hoar
     With time and trials, and those helpless eyes
       And heartless daughters—worn and pale and poor,
     Would he adore a sultan? He obey
     The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?
     Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!
       Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,
     And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,
       Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,
     The vulgarest tool that tyranny could want,
       With just enough of talent and no more,
     To lengthen fetters by another fixed
     And offer poison long already mixed.
     An orator of such set trash of phrase,
       Ineffably, legitimately vile,
     That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,
       Nor foes—all nations—condescend to smile.
     Not even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze
       From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,
     That turns and turns to give the world a notion
     Of endless torments and perpetual motion.
     A bungler even in its disgusting trade,
       And botching, patching, leaving still behind
     Something of which its masters are afraid,
       States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,
     Conspiracy or congress to be made,
       Cobbling at manacles for all mankind,
     A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,
     With God and man's abhorrence for its gains.
     If we may judge of matter by the mind,
     Emasculated to the marrow, it
     Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,
     Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,
     Eutropius of its many masters, blind
     To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,
     Fearless, because no feeling dwells in ice;
     Its very courage stagnates to a vice.
     Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds,
       For I will never feel them. Italy,
     Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds
       Beneath the lie this state-thing breathed o'er thee.
     Thy clanking chain and Erin's yet green wounds
       Have voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.
     Europe has slaves, allies, kings, armies still,
     And Southey lives to sing them very ill.
     Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate
       In honest simple verse this song to you.
     And if in flattering strains I do not predicate,
       'Tis that I still retain my buff and blue;
     My politics as yet are all to educate.
       Apostasy's so fashionable too,
     To keep one creed's a task grown quite
     Herculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?
CANTO THE FIRST
     I want a hero: an uncommon want,
       When every year and month sends forth a new one,
     Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,
       The age discovers he is not the true one;
     Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,
       I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan—
     We all have seen him, in the pantomime,
     Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.
     Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,
       Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,
     Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,
       And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;
     Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,
       Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow:
     France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier
     Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.
     Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,
       Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,
     Were French, and famous people, as we know:
       And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
     Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,
       With many of the military set,
     Exceedingly remarkable at times,
     But not at all adapted to my rhymes.
     Nelson was once Britannia's god of war,
       And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;
     There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
       'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;
     Because the army 's grown more popular,
       At which the naval people are concern'd;
     Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,
     Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.
     Brave men were living before Agamemnon
       And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
     A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
       But then they shone not on the poet's page,
     And so have been forgotten:—I condemn none,
       But can't find any in the present age
     Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);
     So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.
     Most epic poets plunge 'in medias res'
       (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
     And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
       What went before—by way of episode,
     While seated after dinner at his ease,
       Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
     Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
     Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.
     That is the usual method, but not mine—
       My way is to begin with the beginning;
     The regularity of my design
       Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,
     And therefore I shall open with a line
       (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)
     Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
     And also of his mother, if you 'd rather.
     In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
       Famous for oranges and women—he
     Who has not seen it will be much to pity,
       So says the proverb—and I quite agree;
     Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,
       Cadiz perhaps—but that you soon may see;
     Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
     A noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.
     His father's name was Jose—Don, of course,—
       A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
     Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
       Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;
     A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
       Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,
     Than Jose, who begot our hero, who
     Begot—but that 's to come—Well, to renew:
     His mother was a learned lady, famed
       For every branch of every science known
     In every Christian language ever named,
       With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,
     She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
       And even the good with inward envy groan,
     Finding themselves so very much exceeded
     In their own way by all the things that she did.
     Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
       All Calderon and greater part of Lope,
     So that if any actor miss'd his part
       She could have served him for the prompter's copy;
     For her Feinagle's were an useless art,
       And he himself obliged to shut up shop—he
     Could never make a memory so fine as
     That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.
     Her favourite science was the mathematical,
       Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
     Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
       Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;
     In short, in all things she was fairly what I call
       A prodigy—her morning dress was dimity,
     Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
     And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.
     She knew the Latin—that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'
       And Greek—the alphabet—I 'm nearly sure;
     She read some French romances here and there,
       Although her mode of speaking was not pure;
     For native Spanish she had no great care,
       At least her conversation was obscure;
     Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
     As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.
     She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,
       And said there was analogy between 'em;
     She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
       But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;
     But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong
       And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,
     ''T is strange—the Hebrew noun which means "I am,"
     The English always use to govern d--n.'
     Some women use their tongues—she look'd a lecture,
       Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,
     An all-in-all sufficient self-director,
       Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,
     The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,
       Whose suicide was almost an anomaly—
     One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'
     (The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').
     In short, she was a walking calculation,
       Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,
     Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,
       Or 'Coelebs' Wife' set out in quest of lovers,
     Morality's prim personification,
       In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;
     To others' share let 'female errors fall,'
     For she had not even one—the worst of all.
     O! she was perfect past all parallel—
       Of any modern female saint's comparison;
     So far above the cunning powers of hell,
       Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;
     Even her minutest motions went as well
       As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:
     In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
     Save thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!
     Perfect she was, but as perfection is
       Insipid in this naughty world of ours,
     Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss
       Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,
     Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss
       (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),
     Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,
     Went plucking various fruit without her leave.
     He was a mortal of the careless kind,
       With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,
     Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
       And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;
     The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
       To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,
     Whisper'd he had a mistress, some said two—
     But for domestic quarrels one will do.
     Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,
       A great opinion of her own good qualities;
     Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
       And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
     But then she had a devil of a spirit,
       And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,
     And let few opportunities escape
     Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.
     This was an easy matter with a man
       Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
     And even the wisest, do the best they can,
       Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
     That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'
       And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
     And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,
     And why and wherefore no one understands.
     'T is pity learned virgins ever wed
       With persons of no sort of education,
     Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,
       Grow tired of scientific conversation:
     I don't choose to say much upon this head,
       I 'm a plain man, and in a single station,
     But—Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
     Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?
     Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd—why,
       Not any of the many could divine,
     Though several thousand people chose to try,
       'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
     I loathe that low vice—curiosity;
       But if there 's anything in which I shine,
     'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
     Not having of my own domestic cares.
     And so I interfered, and with the best
       Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;
     I think the foolish people were possess'd,
       For neither of them could I ever find,
     Although their porter afterwards confess'd—
       But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,
     For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,
     A pail of housemaid's water unawares.
     A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,
       And mischief-making monkey from his birth;
     His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
       Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;
     Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in
       Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth
     To school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,
     To teach him manners for the time to come.
     Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
       For some time an unhappy sort of life,
     Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;
       They lived respectably as man and wife,
     Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
       And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
     Until at length the smother'd fire broke out,
     And put the business past all kind of doubt.
     For Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,
       And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;
     But as he had some lucid intermissions,
       She next decided he was only bad;
     Yet when they ask'd her for her depositions,
       No sort of explanation could be had,
     Save that her duty both to man and God
     Required this conduct—which seem'd very odd.
     She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
       And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,
     All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
       And then she had all Seville for abettors,
     Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
       The hearers of her case became repeaters,
     Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
     Some for amusement, others for old grudges.
     And then this best and weakest woman bore
       With such serenity her husband's woes,
     Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
       Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose
     Never to say a word about them more—
       Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
     And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
     That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'
     No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
       Is philosophic in our former friends;
     'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
       The more so in obtaining our own ends;
     And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'
       Conduct like this by no means comprehends;
     Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue,
     But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.
     And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
       And help them with a lie or two additional,
     I 'm not to blame, as you well know—no more is
       Any one else—they were become traditional;
     Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
       By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
     And science profits by this resurrection—
     Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.
     Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
       Then their relations, who made matters worse.
     ('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
       To whom it may be best to have recourse—
     I can't say much for friend or yet relation):
       The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,
     But scarce a fee was paid on either side
     Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.
     He died: and most unluckily, because,
       According to all hints I could collect
     From counsel learned in those kinds of laws
       (Although their talk 's obscure and circumspect),
     His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
       A thousand pities also with respect
     To public feeling, which on this occasion
     Was manifested in a great sensation.
     But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay
       The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
     His house was sold, his servants sent away,
       A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
     A priest the other—at least so they say:
       I ask'd the doctors after his disease—
     He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,
     And left his widow to her own aversion.
     Yet Jose was an honourable man,
       That I must say who knew him very well;
     Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan
       Indeed there were not many more to tell;
     And if his passions now and then outran
       Discretion, and were not so peaceable
     As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
     He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.
     Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,
       Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.
     Let 's own—since it can do no good on earth—
       It was a trying moment that which found him
     Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,
       Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:
     No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
     Save death or Doctors' Commons—so he died.
     Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
       To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,
     Which, with a long minority and care,
       Promised to turn out well in proper hands:
     Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,
       And answer'd but to nature's just demands;
     An only son left with an only mother
     Is brought up much more wisely than another.
     Sagest of women, even of widows, she
       Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,
     And worthy of the noblest pedigree
       (His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):
     Then for accomplishments of chivalry,
       In case our lord the king should go to war again,
     He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
     And how to scale a fortress—or a nunnery.
     But that which Donna Inez most desired,
       And saw into herself each day before all
     The learned tutors whom for him she hired,
       Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;
     Much into all his studies she inquired,
       And so they were submitted first to her, all,
     Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery
     To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.
     The languages, especially the dead,
       The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
     The arts, at least all such as could be said
       To be the most remote from common use,
     In all these he was much and deeply read;
       But not a page of any thing that 's loose,
     Or hints continuation of the species,
     Was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.
     His classic studies made a little puzzle,
       Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
     Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
       But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
     His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
       And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
     Were forced to make an odd sort! of apology,
     For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.
     Ovid 's a rake, as half his verses show him,
       Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
     Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
       I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
     Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
       Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
     But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
     Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'
     Lucretius' irreligion is too strong,
       For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;
     I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
       Although no doubt his real intent was good,
     For speaking out so plainly in his song,
       So much indeed as to be downright rude;
     And then what proper person can be partial
     To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?
     Juan was taught from out the best edition,
       Expurgated by learned men, who place
     Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
       The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
     Too much their modest bard by this omission,
       And pitying sore his mutilated case,
     They only add them all in an appendix,
     Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;
     For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'
       Instead of being scatter'd through the Pages;
     They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,
       To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,
     Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
       To call them back into their separate cages,
     Instead of standing staring all together,
     Like garden gods—and not so decent either.
     The Missal too (it was the family Missal)
       Was ornamented in a sort of way
     Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all
       Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,
     Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,
       Could turn their optics to the text and pray,
     Is more than I know—But Don Juan's mother
     Kept this herself, and gave her son another.
     Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
       And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
     To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
       He did not take such studies for restraints;
     But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,
       So well not one of the aforesaid paints
     As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
     Which make the reader envy his transgressions.
     This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan—
       I can't but say that his mamma was right,
     If such an education was the true one.
       She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
     Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
       You might be sure she was a perfect fright;
     She did this during even her husband's life—
     I recommend as much to every wife.
     Young Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;
       At six a charming child, and at eleven
     With all the promise of as fine a face
       As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:
     He studied steadily, and grew apace,
       And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,
     For half his days were pass'd at church, the other
     Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.
     At six, I said, he was a charming child,
       At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;
     Although in infancy a little wild,
       They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
     His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,
       At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy
     Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,
     Her young philosopher was grown already.
     I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
       But what I say is neither here nor there:
     I knew his father well, and have some skill
       In character—but it would not be fair
     From sire to son to augur good or ill:
       He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair—
     But scandal 's my aversion—I protest
     Against all evil speaking, even in jest.
     For my part I say nothing—nothing—but
       This I will say—my reasons are my own—
     That if I had an only son to put
       To school (as God be praised that I have none),
     'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
       Him up to learn his catechism alone,
     No—no—I 'd send him out betimes to college,
     For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.
     For there one learns—'t is not for me to boast,
       Though I acquired—but I pass over that,
     As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
       I say that there 's the place—but 'Verbum sat.'
     I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,
       Knowledge of matters—but no matter what—
     I never married—but, I think, I know
     That sons should not be educated so.
     Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,
       Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd
     Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
       And everybody but his mother deem'd
     Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
       And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)
     If any said so, for to be precocious
     Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.
     Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all
       Selected for discretion and devotion,
     There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
       Pretty were but to give a feeble notion
     Of many charms in her as natural
       As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,
     Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid
     (But this last simile is trite and stupid).
     The darkness of her Oriental eye
       Accorded with her Moorish origin
     (Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;
       In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);
     When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
       Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin
     Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,
     Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.
     She married (I forget the pedigree)
       With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down
     His blood less noble than such blood should be;
       At such alliances his sires would frown,
     In that point so precise in each degree
       That they bred in and in, as might be shown,
     Marrying their cousins—nay, their aunts, and nieces,
     Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.
     This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
       Ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh;
     For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain
       Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;
     The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
       But there 's a rumour which I fain would hush,
     'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma
     Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.
     However this might be, the race went on
       Improving still through every generation,
     Until it centred in an only son,
       Who left an only daughter; my narration
     May have suggested that this single one
       Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion
     I shall have much to speak about), and she
     Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.
     Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)
       Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
     Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
       Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
     And love than either; and there would arise
       A something in them which was not desire,
     But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
     Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.
     Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
       Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
     Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,
       Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
     Mounting at times to a transparent glow,
       As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
     Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:
     Her stature tall—I hate a dumpy woman.
     Wedded she was some years, and to a man
       Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
     And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
       'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
     Especially in countries near the sun:
       And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'
     Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
     Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.
     'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
       And all the fault of that indecent sun,
     Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
       But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
     That howsoever people fast and pray,
       The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
     What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
     Is much more common where the climate 's sultry.
     Happy the nations of the moral North!
       Where all is virtue, and the winter season
     Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth
       ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
     Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
       By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on
     The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
     Because it is a marketable vice.
     Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
       A man well looking for his years, and who
     Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:
       They lived together, as most people do,
     Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
       And not exactly either one or two;
     Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,
     For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.
     Julia was—yet I never could see why—
       With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
     Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
       For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:
     Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,
       For malice still imputes some private end,
     That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
     Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;
     And that still keeping up the old connection,
       Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,
     She took his lady also in affection,
       And certainly this course was much the best:
     She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,
       And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;
     And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
     At least she left it a more slender handle.
     I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
       With other people's eyes, or if her own
     Discoveries made, but none could be aware
       Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;
     Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
       Indifferent from the first or callous grown:
     I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,
     She kept her counsel in so close a way.
     Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
       Caress'd him often—such a thing might be
     Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,
       When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;
     But I am not so sure I should have smiled
       When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;
     These few short years make wondrous alterations,
     Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.
     Whate'er the cause might be, they had become
       Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,
     Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
       And much embarrassment in either eye;
     There surely will be little doubt with some
       That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
     But as for Juan, he had no more notion
     Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.
     Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,
       And tremulously gentle her small hand
     Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
       A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
     And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
       'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
     Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art
     Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.
     And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
       She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,
     As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
       She must not own, but cherish'd more the while
     For that compression in its burning core;
       Even innocence itself has many a wile,
     And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
     And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.
     But passion most dissembles, yet betrays
       Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
     Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays
       Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,
     And in whatever aspect it arrays
       Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
     Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,
     Are masks it often wears, and still too late.
     Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
       And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
     And burning blushes, though for no transgression,
       Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;
     All these are little preludes to possession,
       Of which young passion cannot be bereft,
     And merely tend to show how greatly love is
     Embarrass'd at first starting with a novice.
     Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
       She felt it going, and resolved to make
     The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
       For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;
     Her resolutions were most truly great,
       And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
     She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,
     As being the best judge of a lady's case.
     She vow'd she never would see Juan more,
       And next day paid a visit to his mother,
     And look'd extremely at the opening door,
       Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;
     Grateful she was, and yet a little sore—
       Again it opens, it can be no other,
     'T is surely Juan now—No! I 'm afraid
     That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.
     She now determined that a virtuous woman
       Should rather face and overcome temptation,
     That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
       Should ever give her heart the least sensation;
     That is to say, a thought beyond the common
       Preference, that we must feel upon occasion
     For people who are pleasanter than others,
     But then they only seem so many brothers.
     And even if by chance—and who can tell?
       The devil 's so very sly—she should discover
     That all within was not so very well,
       And, if still free, that such or such a lover
     Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
       Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;
     And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
     I recommend young ladies to make trial.
     And then there are such things as love divine,
       Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
     Such as the angels think so very fine,
       And matrons who would be no less secure,
     Platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'
       Thus Julia said—and thought so, to be sure;
     And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
     On whom her reveries celestial ran.
     Such love is innocent, and may exist
       Between young persons without any danger.
     A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;
       For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,
     But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
       Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
     If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
     But not my fault—I tell them all in time.
     Love, then, but love within its proper limits,
       Was Julia's innocent determination
     In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its
       Exertion might be useful on occasion;
     And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
       Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
     He might be taught, by love and her together—
     I really don't know what, nor Julia either.
     Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
       In mail of proof—her purity of soul—
     She, for the future of her strength convinced.
       And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
     Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
       With any kind of troublesome control;
     But whether Julia to the task was equal
     Is that which must be mention'd in the sequel.
     Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,
       And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
     Not scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable,
       Or if they did so, satisfied to mean
     Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable—
       A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
     Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
     That all the Apostles would have done as they did.
     And if in the mean time her husband died,
       But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
     Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)
       Never could she survive that common loss;
     But just suppose that moment should betide,
       I only say suppose it—inter nos.
     (This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
     In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)
     I only say suppose this supposition:
       Juan being then grown up to man's estate
     Would fully suit a widow of condition,
       Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
     And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
       The mischief, after all, could not be great,
     For he would learn the rudiments of love,
     I mean the seraph way of those above.
     So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.
       Poor little fellow! he had no idea
     Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
       In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,
     He puzzled over what he found a new one,
       But not as yet imagined it could be
     Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
     Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.
     Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
       His home deserted for the lonely wood,
     Tormented with a wound he could not know,
       His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
     I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,
       But then, I beg it may be understood,
     By solitude I mean a sultan's, not
     A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.
     'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,
       Where transport and security entwine,
     Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
       And here thou art a god indeed divine.'
     The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
       With the exception of the second line,
     For that same twining 'transport and security'
     Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.
     The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
       To the good sense and senses of mankind,
     The very thing which every body feels,
       As all have found on trial, or may find,
     That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals
       Or love.—I won't say more about 'entwined'
     Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,
     But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.
     Young Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,
       Thinking unutterable things; he threw
     Himself at length within the leafy nooks
       Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
     There poets find materials for their books,
       And every now and then we read them through,
     So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
     Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.
     He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
       His self-communion with his own high soul,
     Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,
       Had mitigated part, though not the whole
     Of its disease; he did the best he could
       With things not very subject to control,
     And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,
     Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.
     He thought about himself, and the whole earth
       Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
     And how the deuce they ever could have birth;
       And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
     How many miles the moon might have in girth,
       Of air-balloons, and of the many bars
     To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;—
     And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.
     In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern
       Longings sublime, and aspirations high,
     Which some are born with, but the most part learn
       To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
     'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
       His brain about the action of the sky;
     If you think 't was philosophy that this did,
     I can't help thinking puberty assisted.
     He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
       And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
     He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
       And how the goddesses came down to men:
     He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,
       And when he look'd upon his watch again,
     He found how much old Time had been a winner—
     He also found that he had lost his dinner.
     Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,
       Boscan, or Garcilasso;—by the wind
     Even as the page is rustled while we look,
       So by the poesy of his own mind
     Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,
       As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
     Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
     According to some good old woman's tale.
     Thus would he while his lonely hours away
       Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;
     Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,
       Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
     A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
       And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
     With—several other things, which I forget,
     Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.
     Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
       Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;
     She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
       But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
     Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease
       Her only son with question or surmise:
     Whether it was she did not see, or would not,
     Or, like all very clever people, could not.
     This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
       For instance—gentlemen, whose ladies take
     Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,
       And break the—Which commandment is 't they break?
     (I have forgot the number, and think no man
       Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)
     I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
     They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.
     A real husband always is suspicious,
       But still no less suspects in the wrong place,
     Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,
       Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,
     By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;
       The last indeed 's infallibly the case:
     And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
     He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.
     Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;
       Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
     The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
       Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,
     Till some confounded escapade has blighted
       The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
     And then the mother cries, the father swears,
     And wonders why the devil he got heirs.
     But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
       Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
     She had some other motive much more near
       For leaving Juan to this new temptation;
     But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;
       Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
     Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
     In case he thought his wife too great a prize.
     It was upon a day, a summer's day.—
       Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
     And so is spring about the end of May;
       The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
     But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,
       And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
     That there are months which nature grows more merry in,—
     March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.
     'T was on a summer's day—the sixth of June:—
       I like to be particular in dates,
     Not only of the age, and year, but moon;
       They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
     Change horses, making history change its tune,
       Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
     Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
     Excepting the post-obits of theology.
     'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour
       Of half-past six—perhaps still nearer seven—
     When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
       As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
     Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
       To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,
     With all the trophies of triumphant song—
     He won them well, and may he wear them long!
     She sate, but not alone; I know not well
       How this same interview had taken place,
     And even if I knew, I should not tell—
       People should hold their tongues in any case;
     No matter how or why the thing befell,
       But there were she and Juan, face to face—
     When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
     But very difficult, to shut their eyes.
     How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart
       Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.
     O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
       Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,
     How self-deceitful is the sagest part
       Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along—
     The precipice she stood on was immense,
     So was her creed in her own innocence.
     She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
       And of the folly of all prudish fears,
     Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,
       And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
     I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,
       Because that number rarely much endears,
     And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
     Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.
     When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'
       They mean to scold, and very often do;
     When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'
       They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
     In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;
       At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,
     But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
     A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.
     Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,
       For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
     By all the vows below to powers above,
       She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
     Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;
       And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
     One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
     Quite by mistake—she thought it was her own;
     Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,
       Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:
     And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
       She seem'd by the distraction of her air.
     'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
       To leave together this imprudent pair,
     She who for many years had watch'd her son so—
     I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.
     The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees
       Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,
     As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'
       Yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp
     His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:
       She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
     Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
     A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.
     I cannot know what Juan thought of this,
       But what he did, is much what you would do;
     His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
       And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
     In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,—
       Love is so very timid when 't is new:
     She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,
     And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.
     The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
       The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they
     Who call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
       Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
     The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
       Sees half the business in a wicked way
     On which three single hours of moonshine smile—
     And then she looks so modest all the while.
     There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
       A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
     To open all itself, without the power
       Of calling wholly back its self-control;
     The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
       Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
     Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
     A loving languor, which is not repose.
     And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
       And half retiring from the glowing arm,
     Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;
       Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,
     Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;
       But then the situation had its charm,
     And then—God knows what next—I can't go on;
     I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.
     O Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,
       With your confounded fantasies, to more
     Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
       Your system feigns o'er the controulless core
     Of human hearts, than all the long array
       Of poets and romancers:—You 're a bore,
     A charlatan, a coxcomb—and have been,
     At best, no better than a go-between.
     And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
       Until too late for useful conversation;
     The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
       I wish indeed they had not had occasion,
     But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?
       Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;
     A little still she strove, and much repented
     And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'—consented.
     'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward
       To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
     Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,
       And must have cost his majesty a treasure:
     For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,
       Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
     I care not for new pleasures, as the old
     Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.
     O Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,
       Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:
     I make a resolution every spring
       Of reformation, ere the year run out,
     But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
       Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:
     I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
     And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.
     Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take—
       Start not! still chaster reader—she 'll be nice hence—
     Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
       This liberty is a poetic licence,
     Which some irregularity may make
       In the design, and as I have a high sense
     Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit
     To beg his pardon when I err a bit.
     This licence is to hope the reader will
       Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,
     Without whose epoch my poetic skill
       For want of facts would all be thrown away),
     But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
       In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say
     'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure
     About the day—the era 's more obscure.
     We 'll talk of that anon.—'T is sweet to hear
       At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
     The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
       By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;
     'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
       'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
     From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
     The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.
     'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
       Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;
     'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
       Our coming, and look brighter when we come;
     'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,
       Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum
     Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,
     The lisp of children, and their earliest words.
     Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
       In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,
     Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes
       From civic revelry to rural mirth;
     Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
       Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,
     Sweet is revenge—especially to women,
     Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.
     Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
       The unexpected death of some old lady
     Or gentleman of seventy years complete,
       Who 've made 'us youth' wait too—too long already
     For an estate, or cash, or country seat,
       Still breaking, but with stamina so steady
     That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
     Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.
     'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,
       By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end
     To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,
       Particularly with a tiresome friend:
     Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;
       Dear is the helpless creature we defend
     Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot
     We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.
     But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
       Is first and passionate love—it stands alone,
     Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
       The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd—all 's known—
     And life yields nothing further to recall
       Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,
     No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven
     Fire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.
     Man 's a strange animal, and makes strange use
       Of his own nature, and the various arts,
     And likes particularly to produce
       Some new experiment to show his parts;
     This is the age of oddities let loose,
       Where different talents find their different marts;
     You 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your
     Labour, there 's a sure market for imposture.
     What opposite discoveries we have seen!
       (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)
     One makes new noses, one a guillotine,
       One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;
     But vaccination certainly has been
       A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,
     With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
     By borrowing a new one from an ox.
     Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
       And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,
     But has not answer'd like the apparatus
       Of the Humane Society's beginning
     By which men are unsuffocated gratis:
       What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!
     I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
     Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.
     'T is said the great came from America;
       Perhaps it may set out on its return,—
     The population there so spreads, they say
       'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
     With war, or plague, or famine, any way,
       So that civilisation they may learn;
     And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is—
     Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?
     This is the patent-age of new inventions
       For killing bodies, and for saving souls,
     All propagated with the best intentions;
       Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals
     Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
       Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,
     Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
     Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.
     Man 's a phenomenon, one knows not what,
       And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
     'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
       Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;
     Few mortals know what end they would be at,
       But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,
     The path is through perplexing ways, and when
     The goal is gain'd, we die, you know—and then—
     What then?—I do not know, no more do you—
       And so good night.—Return we to our story:
     'T was in November, when fine days are few,
       And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
     And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;
       And the sea dashes round the promontory,
     And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
     And sober suns must set at five o'clock.
     'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
       No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud
     By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright
       With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;
     There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,
       Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:
     I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,
     A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.
     'T was midnight—Donna Julia was in bed,
       Sleeping, most probably,—when at her door
     Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
       If they had never been awoke before,
     And that they have been so we all have read,
       And are to be so, at the least, once more.--
     The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist
     First knocks were heard, then 'Madam—Madam—hist!
     'For God's sake, Madam—Madam—here 's my master,
       With more than half the city at his back—
     Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!
       'T is not my fault—I kept good watch—Alack!
     Do pray undo the bolt a little faster—
       They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack
     Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly—
     Surely the window 's not so very high!'
     By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,
       With torches, friends, and servants in great number;
     The major part of them had long been wived,
       And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
     Of any wicked woman, who contrived
       By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:
     Examples of this kind are so contagious,
     Were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.
     I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
       Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;
     But for a cavalier of his condition
       It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
     Without a word of previous admonition,
       To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
     And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,
     To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.
     Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep
       (Mind—that I do not say—she had not slept),
     Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
       Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,
     Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,
       As if she had just now from out them crept:
     I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
     To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.
     But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
       Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who
     Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
       Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,
     And therefore side by side were gently laid,
       Until the hours of absence should run through,
     And truant husband should return, and say,
     'My dear, I was the first who came away.'
     Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,
       'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?
     Has madness seized you? would that I had died
       Ere such a monster's victim I had been!
     What may this midnight violence betide,
       A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
     Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
     Search, then, the room!'—Alfonso said, 'I will.'
     He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,
       Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,
     And found much linen, lace, and several pair
       Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
     With other articles of ladies fair,
       To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
     Arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,
     And wounded several shutters, and some boards.
     Under the bed they search'd, and there they found—
       No matter what—it was not that they sought;
     They open'd windows, gazing if the ground
       Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;
     And then they stared each other's faces round:
       'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
     And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
     Of looking in the bed as well as under.
     During this inquisition, Julia's tongue
       Was not asleep—'Yes, search and search,' she cried,
     'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!
       It was for this that I became a bride!
     For this in silence I have suffer'd long
       A husband like Alfonso at my side;
     But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,
     If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.
     'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
       If ever you indeed deserved the name,
     Is 't worthy of your years?—you have threescore—
       Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same—
     Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore
       For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
     Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,
     How dare you think your lady would go on so?
     'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold
       The common privileges of my sex?
     That I have chosen a confessor so old
       And deaf, that any other it would vex,
     And never once he has had cause to scold,
       But found my very innocence perplex
     So much, he always doubted I was married—
     How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!
     'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er
       I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
     Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,
       Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
     Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,
       I favor'd none—nay, was almost uncivil?
     Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,
     Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?
     'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani
       Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
     Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
       Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
     Were there not also Russians, English, many?
       The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
     And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,
     Who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.
     'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,
       The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?
     And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
       I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:
     I praise your vast forbearance not to beat
       Me also, since the time so opportune is—
     O, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,
     Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?
     'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.
       Under pretence of business indispensable
     With that sublime of rascals your attorney,
       Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible
     Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he
       Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,
     Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
     And not from any love to you nor me.
     'If he comes here to take a deposition,
       By all means let the gentleman proceed;
     You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:
       There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need—
     Let every thing be noted with precision,
       I would not you for nothing should be fee'd—
     But, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'
     'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'
     'There is the closet, there the toilet, there
       The antechamber—search them under, over;
     There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
       The chimney—which would really hold a lover.
     I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
       And make no further noise, till you discover
     The secret cavern of this lurking treasure—
     And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.
     'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown
       Doubt upon me, confusion over all,
     Pray have the courtesy to make it known
       Who is the man you search for? how d' ye cal
     Him? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown—
       I hope he 's young and handsome—is he tall?
     Tell me—and be assured, that since you stain
     My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.
     'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
       At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
     Or for so young a husband's jealous fears
       (Antonia! let me have a glass of water).
     I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
       They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
     My mother dream'd not in my natal hour
     That I should fall into a monster's power.
     'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
       You saw that she was sleeping by my side
     When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
       Look where you please—we 've nothing, sir, to hide;
     Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,
       Or for the sake of decency abide
     A moment at the door, that we may be
     Drest to receive so much good company.
     'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
       The little I have said may serve to show
     The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
       The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
     I leave you to your conscience as before,
       'T will one day ask you why you used me so?
     God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-
     Antonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?'
     She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale
       She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
     Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
       Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears
     Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,
       To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
     Its snow through all;—her soft lips lie apart,
     And louder than her breathing beats her heart.
     The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
       Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,
     And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
       Her master and his myrmidons, of whom
     Not one, except the attorney, was amused;
       He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
     So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
     Knowing they must be settled by the laws.
     With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,
       Following Antonia's motions here and there,
     With much suspicion in his attitude;
       For reputations he had little care;
     So that a suit or action were made good,
       Small pity had he for the young and fair,
     And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
     Were proved by competent false witnesses.
     But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
       And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
     When, after searching in five hundred nooks,
       And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
     He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,
       Added to those his lady with such vigour
     Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,
     Quick, thick, and heavy—as a thunder-shower.
     At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
       To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,
     And indications of hysterics, whose
       Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,
     Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:
       Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;
     He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
     And then he tried to muster all his patience.
     He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
       But sage Antonia cut him short before
     The anvil of his speech received the hammer,
       With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,
     Or madam dies.'—Alfonso mutter'd, 'D—n her,'
       But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
     He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
     He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.
     With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'
       The attorney last, who linger'd near the door
     Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as
       Antonia let him—not a little sore
     At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'
       In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
     An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
     The door was fasten'd in his legal face.
     No sooner was it bolted, than—Oh shame!
       O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!
     How can you do such things and keep your fame,
       Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
     Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!
       But to proceed—for there is more behind:
     With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
     Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.
     He had been hid—I don't pretend to say
       How, nor can I indeed describe the where—
     Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,
       No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
     But pity him I neither must nor may
       His suffocation by that pretty pair;
     'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
     With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.
     And, secondly, I pity not, because
       He had no business to commit a sin,
     Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,
       At least 't was rather early to begin;
     But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
       So much as when we call our old debts in
     At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
     And find a deuced balance with the devil.
     Of his position I can give no notion:
       'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
     How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
       Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,
     When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,
       And that the medicine answer'd very well;
     Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
     For David lived, but Juan nearly died.
     What 's to be done? Alfonso will be back
       The moment he has sent his fools away.
     Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,
       But no device could be brought into play—
     And how to parry the renew'd attack?
       Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
     Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,
     But press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.
     He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand
       Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;
     Even then their love they could not all command,
       And half forgot their danger and despair:
     Antonia's patience now was at a stand—
       'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'
     She whisper'd, in great wrath—'I must deposit
     This pretty gentleman within the closet:
     'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night—
       Who can have put my master in this mood?
     What will become on 't—I 'm in such a fright,
       The devil 's in the urchin, and no good—
     Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?
       Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
     You 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,
     My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.
     'Had it but been for a stout cavalier
       Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)—
     But for a child, what piece of work is here!
       I really, madam, wonder at your taste
     (Come, sir, get in)—my master must be near:
       There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
     And if we can but till the morning keep
     Our counsel—(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'
     Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,
       Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
     She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,
       An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;
     However, present remedy was none,
       And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:
     Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,
     She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.
     Alfonso paused a minute—then begun
       Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
     He would not justify what he had done,
       To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;
     But there were ample reasons for it, none
       Of which he specified in this his pleading:
     His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
     Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'
     Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
       A ready answer, which at once enables
     A matron, who her husband's foible knows,
       By a few timely words to turn the tables,
     Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,—
       Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
     'T is to retort with firmness, and when he
     Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.
     Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,—
       Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,
     But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds—
       But that can't be, as has been often shown,
     A lady with apologies abounds;—
       It might be that her silence sprang alone
     From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
     To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.
     There might be one more motive, which makes two;
       Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,—
     Mention'd his jealousy but never who
       Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
     Conceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true,
       His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
     To speak of Inez now were, one may say,
     Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.
     A hint, in tender cases, is enough;
       Silence is best, besides there is a tact
     (That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,
       But it will serve to keep my verse compact)—
     Which keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough,
       A lady always distant from the fact:
     The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
     There 's nothing so becoming to the face.
     They blush, and we believe them; at least I
       Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
     In any case, attempting a reply,
       For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
     And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,
       And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
     A tear or two, and then we make it up;
     And then—and then—and then—sit down and sup.
     Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,
       Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,
     And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
       Denying several little things he wanted:
     He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
       With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,
     Beseeching she no further would refuse,
     When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.
     A pair of shoes!—what then? not much, if they
       Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
     (No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
       Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,
     Was but a moment's act.—Ah! well-a-day!
       My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze—
     Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
     And then flew out into another passion.
     He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,
       And Julia instant to the closet flew.
     'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake—not a word—
       The door is open—you may yet slip through
     The passage you so often have explored—
       Here is the garden-key—Fly—fly—Adieu!
     Haste—haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet—
     Day has not broke—there 's no one in the street:
     None can say that this was not good advice,
       The only mischief was, it came too late;
     Of all experience 't is the usual price,
       A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
     Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,
       And might have done so by the garden-gate,
     But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,
     Who threaten'd death—so Juan knock'd him down.
     Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
       Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'
     But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.
       Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,
     Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
       And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
     His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
     And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.
     Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,
       And they continued battling hand to hand,
     For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;
       His temper not being under great command,
     If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
       Alfonso's days had not been in the land
     Much longer.—Think of husbands', lovers' lives!
     And how ye may be doubly widows—wives!
     Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
       And Juan throttled him to get away,
     And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;
       At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
     Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
       And then his only garment quite gave way;
     He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
     I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.
     Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
       An awkward spectacle their eyes before;
     Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,
       Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;
     Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,
       Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
     Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,
     And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.
     Here ends this canto.—Need I sing, or say,
       How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,
     Who favours what she should not, found his way,
       And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?
     The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
       The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
     And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
     Were in the English newspapers, of course.
     If you would like to see the whole proceedings,
       The depositions, and the cause at full,
     The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
       Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,
     There 's more than one edition, and the readings
       Are various, but they none of them are dull;
     The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,
     Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.
     But Donna Inez, to divert the train
       Of one of the most circulating scandals
     That had for centuries been known in Spain,
       At least since the retirement of the Vandals,
     First vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)
       To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;
     And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
     She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.
     She had resolved that he should travel through
       All European climes, by land or sea,
     To mend his former morals, and get new,
       Especially in France and Italy
     (At least this is the thing most people do).
       Julia was sent into a convent: she
     Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better
     Shown in the following copy of her Letter:—
     'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
       'T is wise—'t is well, but not the less a pain;
     I have no further claim on your young heart,
       Mine is the victim, and would be again;
     To love too much has been the only art
       I used;—I write in haste, and if a stain
     Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
     My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.
     'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
       State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,
     And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
       So dear is still the memory of that dream;
     Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
       None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
     I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest—
     I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.
     'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
       'T is woman's whole existence; man may range
     The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;
       Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange
     Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,
       And few there are whom these cannot estrange;
     Men have all these resources, we but one,
     To love again, and be again undone.
     'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
       Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
     For me on earth, except some years to hide
       My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core;
     These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
       The passion which still rages as before—
     And so farewell—forgive me, love me—No,
     That word is idle now—but let it go.
     'My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;
       But still I think I can collect my mind;
     My blood still rushes where my spirit 's set,
       As roll the waves before the settled wind;
     My heart is feminine, nor can forget—
       To all, except one image, madly blind;
     So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
     As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.
     'I have no more to say, but linger still,
       And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,
     And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
       My misery can scarce be more complete:
     I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
       Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,
     And I must even survive this last adieu,
     And bear with life, to love and pray for you!'
     This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
       With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:
     Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
       It trembled as magnetic needles do,
     And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
       The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'
     The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
     The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.
     This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
       I shall proceed with his adventures is
     Dependent on the public altogether;
       We 'll see, however, what they say to this:
     Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,
       And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;
     And if their approbation we experience,
     Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.
     My poem 's epic, and is meant to be
       Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
     With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,
       A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
     New characters; the episodes are three:
       A panoramic view of hell 's in training,
     After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
     So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.
     All these things will be specified in time,
       With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
     The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
       Which makes so many poets, and some fools:
     Prose poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,
       Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;
     I 've got new mythological machinery,
     And very handsome supernatural scenery.
     There 's only one slight difference between
       Me and my epic brethren gone before,
     And here the advantage is my own, I ween
       (Not that I have not several merits more,
     But this will more peculiarly be seen);
       They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
     Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
     Whereas this story 's actually true.
     If any person doubt it, I appeal
       To history, tradition, and to facts,
     To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
       To plays in five, and operas in three acts;
     All these confirm my statement a good deal,
       But that which more completely faith exacts
     Is that myself, and several now in Seville,
     Saw Juan's last elopement with the devil.
     If ever I should condescend to prose,
       I 'll write poetical commandments, which
     Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
       That went before; in these I shall enrich
     My text with many things that no one knows,
       And carry precept to the highest pitch:
     I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,
     Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'
     Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
       Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;
     Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,
       The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:
     With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
       And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
     Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
     Commit—flirtation with the muse of Moore.
     Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
       His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;
     Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'
       (There 's one, at least, is very fond of this);
     Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
       This is true criticism, and you may kiss—
     Exactly as you please, or not,—the rod;
     If any person should presume to assert
       This story is not moral, first, I pray,
     That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,
       Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say
     (But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
       That this is not a moral tale, though gay;
     Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
     The very place where wicked people go.
     If, after all, there should be some so blind
       To their own good this warning to despise,
     Led by some tortuosity of mind,
       Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
     And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'
       I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
     Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
     They also lie too—under a mistake.
     The public approbation I expect,
       And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,
     Which I with their amusement will connect
       (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
     Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect
       My epical pretensions to the laurel:
     For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,
     I 've bribed my grandmother's review—the British.
     I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
       Who thank'd me duly by return of post—
     I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;
       Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
     And break a promise after having made it her,
       Denying the receipt of what it cost,
     And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
     All I can say is—that he had the money.
     I think that with this holy new alliance
       I may ensure the public, and defy
     All other magazines of art or science,
       Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I
     Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,
       Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
     And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
     Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.
     'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa
       Consule Planco,' Horace said, and so
     Say I; by which quotation there is meant a
       Hint that some six or seven good years ago
     (Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)
       I was most ready to return a blow,
     And would not brook at all this sort of thing
     In my hot youth—when George the Third was King.
     But now at thirty years my hair is grey
       (I wonder what it will be like at forty?
     I thought of a peruke the other day)—
       My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I
     Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,
       And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
     Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
     And deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.
     No more—no more—Oh! never more on me
       The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,
     Which out of all the lovely things we see
       Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
     Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:
       Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
     Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
     To double even the sweetness of a flower.
     No more—no more—Oh! never more, my heart,
       Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
     Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
       Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
     The illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art
       Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,
     And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,
     Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.
     My days of love are over; me no more
       The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
     Can make the fool of which they made before,—
       In short, I must not lead the life I did do;
     The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,
       The copious use of claret is forbid too,
     So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
     I think I must take up with avarice.
     Ambition was my idol, which was broken
       Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
     And the two last have left me many a token
       O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
     Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I 've spoken,
       'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'—a chymic treasure
     Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes—
     My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.
     What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill
       A certain portion of uncertain paper:
     Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
       Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;
     For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
       And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'
     To have, when the original is dust,
     A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.
     What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King
       Cheops erected the first pyramid
     And largest, thinking it was just the thing
       To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
     But somebody or other rummaging,
       Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
     Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
     Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.
     But I being fond of true philosophy,
       Say very often to myself, 'Alas!
     All things that have been born were born to die,
       And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
     You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,
       And if you had it o'er again—'t would pass—
     So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
     And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'
     But for the present, gentle reader! and
       Still gentler purchaser! the bard—that 's I—
     Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,
       And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'
     We meet again, if we should understand
       Each other; and if not, I shall not try
     Your patience further than by this short sample—
     'T were well if others follow'd my example.
     'Go, little book, from this my solitude!
       I cast thee on the waters—go thy ways!
     And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
       The world will find thee after many days.'
     When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
       I can't help putting in my claim to praise—
     The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:
     For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.
Canto 2
CANTO THE SECOND.
     O ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,
       Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,
     I pray ye flog them upon all occasions,
       It mends their morals, never mind the pain:
     The best of mothers and of educations
       In Juan's case were but employ'd in vain,
     Since, in a way that 's rather of the oddest, he
     Became divested of his native modesty.
     Had he but been placed at a public school,
       In the third form, or even in the fourth,
     His daily task had kept his fancy cool,
       At least, had he been nurtured in the north;
     Spain may prove an exception to the rule,
       But then exceptions always prove its worth—
     A lad of sixteen causing a divorce
     Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.
     I can't say that it puzzles me at all,
       If all things be consider'd: first, there was
     His lady—mother, mathematical,
       A—never mind; his tutor, an old ass;
     A pretty woman (that 's quite natural,
       Or else the thing had hardly come to pass);
     A husband rather old, not much in unity
     With his young wife—a time, and opportunity.
     Well—well, the world must turn upon its axis,
       And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,
     And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,
       And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;
     The king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,
       The priest instructs, and so our life exhales,
     A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,
     Fighting, devotion, dust,—perhaps a name.
     I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz—
       A pretty town, I recollect it well—
     'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is
       (Or was, before Peru learn'd to rebel),
     And such sweet girls—I mean, such graceful ladies,
       Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
     I can't describe it, though so much it strike,
     Nor liken it—I never saw the like:
     An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb
       New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,
     No—none of these will do;—and then their garb!
       Their veil and petticoat—Alas! to dwell
     Upon such things would very near absorb
       A canto—then their feet and ankles,—well,
     Thank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready
     (And so, my sober Muse—come, let 's be steady—
     Chaste Muse!—well, if you must, you must)—the veil
       Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,
     While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,
       Flashes into the heart:—All sunny land
     Of love! when I forget you, may I fail
       To—say my prayers—but never was there plann'd
     A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,
     Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.
     But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent
       Her son to Cadiz only to embark;
     To stay there had not answer'd her intent,
       But why?—we leave the reader in the dark—
     'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,
       As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,
     To wean him from the wickedness of earth,
     And send him like a dove of promise forth.
     Don Juan bade his valet pack his things
       According to direction, then received
     A lecture and some money: for four springs
       He was to travel; and though Inez grieved
     (As every kind of parting has its stings),
       She hoped he would improve—perhaps believed:
     A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)
     Of good advice—and two or three of credit.
     In the mean time, to pass her hours away,
       Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school
     For naughty children, who would rather play
       (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;
     Infants of three years old were taught that day,
       Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:
     The great success of Juan's education,
     Spurr'd her to teach another generation.
     Juan embark'd—the ship got under way,
       The wind was fair, the water passing rough:
     A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,
       As I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;
     And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray
       Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:
     And there he stood to take, and take again,
     His first—perhaps his last—farewell of Spain.
     I can't but say it is an awkward sight
       To see one's native land receding through
     The growing waters; it unmans one quite,
       Especially when life is rather new:
     I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,
       But almost every other country 's blue,
     When gazing on them, mystified by distance,
     We enter on our nautical existence.
     So Juan stood, bewilder'd on the deck:
       The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,
     And the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,
       From which away so fair and fast they bore.
     The best of remedies is a beef-steak
       Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before
     You sneer, and I assure you this is true,
     For I have found it answer—so may you.
     Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,
       Beheld his native Spain receding far:
     First partings form a lesson hard to learn,
       Even nations feel this when they go to war;
     There is a sort of unexprest concern,
       A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar:
     At leaving even the most unpleasant people
     And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.
     But Juan had got many things to leave,
       His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,
     So that he had much better cause to grieve
       Than many persons more advanced in life;
     And if we now and then a sigh must heave
       At quitting even those we quit in strife,
     No doubt we weep for those the heart endears—
     That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.
     So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews
       By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:
     I 'd weep,—but mine is not a weeping Muse,
       And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;
     Young men should travel, if but to amuse
       Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on
     Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,
     Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.
     And Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,
       While his salt tears dropp'd into the salt sea,
     'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;
       You must excuse this extract, 't is where she,
     The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought
       Flowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he
     Reflected on his present situation,
     And seriously resolved on reformation.
     'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,
       'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,
     But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,
       Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:
     Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!
       Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,
     Farewell, too, dearest Julia!—(Here he drew
     Her letter out again, and read it through.)
     'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear—
       But that 's impossible, and cannot be—
     Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,
       Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,
     Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!
       Or think of any thing excepting thee;
     A mind diseased no remedy can physic
     (Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).
     'Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),
       O, Julia! what is every other wo?
     (For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;
       Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)
     Julia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)—
       O, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)—
     Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'
     (Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)
     He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
       Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,
     Beyond the best apothecary's art,
       The loss of love, the treachery of friends,
     Or death of those we dote on, when a part
       Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:
     No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,
     But the sea acted as a strong emetic. I
     Love 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold
       Out through a fever caused by its own heat,
     But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,
       And find a quincy very hard to treat;
     Against all noble maladies he 's bold,
       But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,
     Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,
     Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.
     But worst of all is nausea, or a pain
       About the lower region of the bowels;
     Love, who heroically breathes a vein,
       Shrinks from the application of hot towels,
     And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,
       Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else
     Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,
     Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?
     The ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'
       Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;
     For there the Spanish family Moncada
       Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:
     They were relations, and for them he had a
       Letter of introduction, which the morn
     Of his departure had been sent him by
     His Spanish friends for those in Italy.
     His suite consisted of three servants and
       A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,
     Who several languages did understand,
       But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,
     And rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,
       His headache being increased by every billow;
     And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
     His berth a little damp, and him afraid.
     'T was not without some reason, for the wind
       Increased at night, until it blew a gale;
     And though 't was not much to a naval mind,
       Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,
     For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:
       At sunset they began to take in sail,
     For the sky show'd it would come on to blow,
     And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.
     At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift
       Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,
     Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,
       Started the stern-post, also shatter'd the
     Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift
       Herself from out her present jeopardy,
     The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound
     The pumps, and there were four feet water found.
     One gang of people instantly was put
       Upon the pumps and the remainder set
     To get up part of the cargo, and what not;
       But they could not come at the leak as yet;
     At last they did get at it really, but
       Still their salvation was an even bet:
     The water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,
     While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,
     Into the opening; but all such ingredients
       Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,
     Despite of all their efforts and expedients,
       But for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known
     To all the brother tars who may have need hence,
       For fifty tons of water were upthrown
     By them per hour, and they had all been undone,
     But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.
     As day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,
       And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,
     And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet
       Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.
     The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
       A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,
     A gust—which all descriptive power transcends—
     Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.
     There she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;
       The water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,
     And made a scene men do not soon forget;
       For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,
     Or any other thing that brings regret,
       Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:
     Thus drownings are much talk'd of by the divers,
     And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.
     Immediately the masts were cut away,
       Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,
     The main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay
       Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.
     Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they
       Eased her at last (although we never meant
     To part with all till every hope was blighted),
     And then with violence the old ship righted.
     It may be easily supposed, while this
       Was going on, some people were unquiet,
     That passengers would find it much amiss
       To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;
     That even the able seaman, deeming his
       Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,
     As upon such occasions tars will ask
     For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.
     There 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
       As rum and true religion: thus it was,
     Some plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,
       The high wind made the treble, and as bas
     The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms
       Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:
     Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,
     Clamour'd in chorus to the roaring ocean.
     Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for
       Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,
     Got to the spirit-room, and stood before
       It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,
     As if Death were more dreadful by his door
       Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,
     Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,
     Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.
     'Give us more grog,' they cried, 'for it will be
       All one an hour hence.' Juan answer'd, 'No!
     'T is true that death awaits both you and me,
       But let us die like men, not sink below
     Like brutes;'—and thus his dangerous post kept he,
       And none liked to anticipate the blow;
     And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,
     Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.
     The good old gentleman was quite aghast,
       And made a loud and pious lamentation;
     Repented all his sins, and made a last
       Irrevocable vow of reformation;
     Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)
       To quit his academic occupation,
     In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,
     To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.
     But now there came a flash of hope once more;
       Day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,
     The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,
       The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.
     They tried the pumps again, and though before
       Their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,
     A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale—
     The stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.
     Under the vessel's keel the sail was past,
       And for the moment it had some effect;
     But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,
       Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?
     But still 't is best to struggle to the last,
       'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:
     And though 't is true that man can only die once,
     'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.
     There winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,
       Without their will, they carried them away;
     For they were forced with steering to dispense,
       And never had as yet a quiet day
     On which they might repose, or even commence
       A jurymast or rudder, or could say
     The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,
     Still swam—though not exactly like a duck.
     The wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,
       But the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope
     To weather out much longer; the distress
       Was also great with which they had to cope
     For want of water, and their solid mess
       Was scant enough: in vain the telescope
     Was used—nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,
     Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.
     Again the weather threaten'd,—again blew
       A gale, and in the fore and after hold
     Water appear'd; yet, though the people knew
       All this, the most were patient, and some bold,
     Until the chains and leathers were worn through
       Of all our pumps:—a wreck complete she roll'd,
     At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are
     Like human beings during civil war.
     Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears
       In his rough eyes, and told the captain he
     Could do no more: he was a man in years,
       And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,
     And if he wept at length, they were not fears
       That made his eyelids as a woman's be,
     But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,—
     Two things for dying people quite bewildering.
     The ship was evidently settling now
       Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,
     Some went to prayers again, and made a vow
       Of candles to their saints—but there were none
     To pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;
       Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
     That begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,
     Who told him to be damn'd—in his confusion.
     Some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on
       Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;
     Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,
       And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
     And others went on as they had begun,
       Getting the boats out, being well aware
     That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,
     Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.
     The worst of all was, that in their condition,
       Having been several days in great distress,
     'T was difficult to get out such provision
       As now might render their long suffering less:
     Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;
       Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
     Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter
     Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.
     But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
       Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;
     Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;
       Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get
     A portion of their beef up from below,
       And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,
     But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon—
     Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.
     The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had
       Been stove in the beginning of the gale;
     And the long-boat's condition was but bad,
       As there were but two blankets for a sail,
     And one oar for a mast, which a young lad
       Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;
     And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,
     To save one half the people then on board.
     'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down
       Over the waste of waters; like a veil,
     Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown
       Of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,
     Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,
       And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
     And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear
     Been their familiar, and now Death was here.
     Some trial had been making at a raft,
       With little hope in such a rolling sea,
     A sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,
       If any laughter at such times could be,
     Unless with people who too much have quaff'd,
       And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,
     Half epileptical and half hysterical:—
     Their preservation would have been a miracle.
     At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,
       And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,
     That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,
       For yet they strove, although of no great use:
     There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
       The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;
     She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,
     And, going down head foremost—sunk, in short.
     Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell—
       Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,
     Then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,
       As eager to anticipate their grave;
     And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,
       And down she suck'd with her the whirling wave,
     Like one who grapples with his enemy,
     And strives to strangle him before he die.
     And first one universal shriek there rush'd,
       Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash
     Of echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,
       Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
     Of billows; but at intervals there gush'd,
       Accompanied with a convulsive splash,
     A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
     Of some strong swimmer in his agony.
     The boats, as stated, had got off before,
       And in them crowded several of the crew;
     And yet their present hope was hardly more
       Than what it had been, for so strong it blew
     There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
       And then they were too many, though so few—
     Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,
     Were counted in them when they got afloat.
     All the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls
       Had left their bodies; and what 's worse, alas!
     When over Catholics the ocean rolls,
       They must wait several weeks before a mass
     Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,
       Because, till people know what 's come to pass,
     They won't lay out their money on the dead—
     It costs three francs for every mass that 's said.
     Juan got into the long-boat, and there
       Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;
     It seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,
       For Juan wore the magisterial face
     Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair
       Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:
     Battista; though (a name call'd shortly Tita),
     Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.
     Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,
       But the same cause, conducive to his loss,
     Left him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave
       As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,
     And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;
       They could not rescue him although so close,
     Because the sea ran higher every minute,
     And for the boat—the crew kept crowding in it.
     A small old spaniel,—which had been Don Jose's,
       His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,
     For on such things the memory reposes
       With tenderness—stood howling on the brink,
     Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),
       No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;
     And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd
     Off, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.
     He also stuff'd his money where he could
       About his person, and Pedrillo's too,
     Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,
       Not knowing what himself to say, or do,
     As every rising wave his dread renew'd;
       But Juan, trusting they might still get through,
     And deeming there were remedies for any ill,
     Thus re-embark'd his tutor and his spaniel.
     'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,
       That the sail was becalm'd between the seas,
     Though on the wave's high top too much to set,
       They dared not take it in for all the breeze:
     Each sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,
       And made them bale without a moment's ease,
     So that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,
     And the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.
     Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still
       Kept above water, with an oar for mast,
     Two blankets stitch'd together, answering ill
       Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast:
     Though every wave roll'd menacing to fill,
       And present peril all before surpass'd,
     They grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,
     And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.
     The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign
       Of the continuance of the gale: to run
     Before the sea until it should grow fine,
       Was all that for the present could be done:
     A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine
       Were served out to the people, who begun
     To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,
     And most of them had little clothes but rags.
     They counted thirty, crowded in a space
       Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;
     They did their best to modify their case,
       One half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,
     While t'other half were laid down in their place
       At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian
     Ague in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,
     With nothing but the sky for a great coat.
     'T is very certain the desire of life
       Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,
     When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,
       Survive through very desperate conditions,
     Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife
       Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:
     Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
     And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.
     'T is said that persons living on annuities
       Are longer lived than others,—God knows why,
     Unless to plague the grantors,—yet so true it is,
       That some, I really think, do never die;
     Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,
       And that 's their mode of furnishing supply:
     In my young days they lent me cash that way,
     Which I found very troublesome to pay.
     'T is thus with people in an open boat,
       They live upon the love of life, and bear
     More than can be believed, or even thought,
       And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
     And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,
       Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;
     She had a curious crew as well as cargo,
     Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.
     But man is a carnivorous production,
       And must have meals, at least one meal a day;
     He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
       But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;
     Although his anatomical construction
       Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,
     Your labouring people think beyond all question,
     Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.
     And thus it was with this our hapless crew;
       For on the third day there came on a calm,
     And though at first their strength it might renew,
       And lying on their weariness like balm,
     Lull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue
       Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,
     And fell all ravenously on their provision,
     Instead of hoarding it with due precision.
     The consequence was easily foreseen—
       They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,
     In spite of all remonstrances, and then
       On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?
     They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!
       And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,
     But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,
     It would have been more wise to save their victual.
     The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,
       And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:
     The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,
       The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild—
     With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)
       What could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:
     So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,
     Was kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.
     On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,
       And Juan, who had still refused, because
     The creature was his father's dog that died,
       Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,
     With some remorse received (though first denied)
       As a great favour one of the fore-paws,
     Which he divided with Pedrillo, who
     Devour'd it, longing for the other too.
     The seventh day, and no wind—the burning sun
       Blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,
     They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,
       Save in the breeze that came not; savagely
     They glared upon each other—all was done,
       Water, and wine, and food,—and you might see
     The longings of the cannibal arise
     (Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.
     At length one whisper'd his companion, who
       Whisper'd another, and thus it went round,
     And then into a hoarser murmur grew,
       An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;
     And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,
       'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:
     And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,
     And who should die to be his fellow's food.
     But ere they came to this, they that day shared
       Some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;
     And then they look'd around them and despair'd,
       And none to be the sacrifice would choose;
     At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,
       But of materials that much shock the Muse—
     Having no paper, for the want of better,
     They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.
     The lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,
       In silent horror, and their distribution
     Lull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,
       Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;
     None in particular had sought or plann'd it,
       'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,
     By which none were permitted to be neuter—
     And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.
     He but requested to be bled to death:
       The surgeon had his instruments, and bled
     Pedrillo, and so gently ebb'd his breath,
       You hardly could perceive when he was dead.
     He died as born, a Catholic in faith,
       Like most in the belief in which they 're bred,
     And first a little crucifix he kiss'd,
     And then held out his jugular and wrist.
     The surgeon, as there was no other fee,
       Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;
     But being thirstiest at the moment, he
       Preferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing veins:
     Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,
       And such things as the entrails and the brains
     Regaled two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow—
     The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.
     The sailors ate him, all save three or four,
       Who were not quite so fond of animal food;
     To these was added Juan, who, before
       Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could
     Feel now his appetite increased much more;
       'T was not to be expected that he should,
     Even in extremity of their disaster,
     Dine with them on his pastor and his master.
     'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,
       The consequence was awful in the extreme;
     For they, who were most ravenous in the act,
       Went raging mad—Lord! how they did blaspheme!
     And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,
       Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,
     Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,
     And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.
     Their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,
       And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;
     And some of them had lost their recollection,
       Happier than they who still perceived their woes;
     But others ponder'd on a new dissection,
       As if not warn'd sufficiently by those
     Who had already perish'd, suffering madly,
     For having used their appetites so sadly.
     And next they thought upon the master's mate,
       As fattest; but he saved himself, because,
     Besides being much averse from such a fate,
       There were some other reasons: the first was,
     He had been rather indisposed of late;
       And that which chiefly proved his saving clause
     Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,
     By general subscription of the ladies.
     Of poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,
       But was used sparingly,—some were afraid,
     And others still their appetites constrain'd,
       Or but at times a little supper made;
     All except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,
       Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:
     At length they caught two boobies and a noddy,
     And then they left off eating the dead body.
     And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
       Remember Ugolino condescends
     To eat the head of his arch-enemy
       The moment after he politely ends
     His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea
       'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,
     When shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,
     Without being much more horrible than Dante.
     And the same night there fell a shower of rain,
       For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth
     When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain
       Men really know not what good water 's worth;
     If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,
       Or with a famish'd boat's-crew had your berth,
     Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,
     You 'd wish yourself where Truth is—in a well.
     It pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer
       Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,
     Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,
       And when they deem'd its moisture was complete
     They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher
       Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet
     As a full pot of porter, to their thinking
     They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.
     And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,
       Suck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;
     Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,
       As the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd
     To beg the beggar, who could not rain back
       A drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd
     To taste of heaven—If this be true, indeed
     Some Christians have a comfortable creed.
     There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,
       And with them their two sons, of whom the one
     Was more robust and hardy to the view,
       But he died early; and when he was gone,
     His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw
       One glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!
     I can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown
     Into the deep without a tear or groan.
     The other father had a weaklier child,
       Of a soft cheek and aspect delicate;
     But the boy bore up long, and with a mild
       And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
     Little he said, and now and then he smiled,
       As if to win a part from off the weight
     He saw increasing on his father's heart,
     With the deep deadly thought that they must part.
     And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised
       His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam
     From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,
       And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,
     And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,
       Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,
     He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
     Into his dying child's mouth—but in vain.
     The boy expired—the father held the clay,
       And look'd upon it long, and when at last
     Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay
       Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,
     He watch'd it wistfully, until away
       'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;
     Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,
     And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.
     Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through
       The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,
     Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;
       And all within its arch appear'd to be
     Clearer than that without, and its wide hue
       Wax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,
     Then changed like to a bow that 's bent, and then
     Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men.
     It changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,
       The airy child of vapour and the sun,
     Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,
       Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,
     Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,
       And blending every colour into one,
     Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
     (For sometimes we must box without the muffle).
     Our shipwreck'd seamen thought it a good omen—
       It is as well to think so, now and then;
     'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,
       And may become of great advantage when
     Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men
       Had greater need to nerve themselves again
     Than these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope—
     Quite a celestial kaleidoscope.
     About this time a beautiful white bird,
       Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size
     And plumage (probably it might have err'd
       Upon its course), pass'd oft before their eyes,
     And tried to perch, although it saw and heard
       The men within the boat, and in this guise
     It came and went, and flutter'd round them till
     Night fell: this seem'd a better omen still.
     But in this case I also must remark,
       'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,
     Because the tackle of our shatter'd bark
       Was not so safe for roosting as a church;
     And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,
       Returning there from her successful search,
     Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,
     They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.
     With twilight it again came on to blow,
       But not with violence; the stars shone out,
     The boat made way; yet now they were so low,
       They knew not where nor what they were about;
     Some fancied they saw land, and some said 'No!'
       The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt—
     Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,
     And all mistook about the latter once.
     As morning broke, the light wind died away,
       When he who had the watch sung out and swore,
     If 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,
       He wish'd that land he never might see more;
     And the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,
       Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;
     For shore it was, and gradually grew
     Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.
     And then of these some part burst into tears,
       And others, looking with a stupid stare,
     Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,
       And seem'd as if they had no further care;
     While a few pray'd (the first time for some years)—
       And at the bottom of the boat three were
     Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,
     And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.
     The day before, fast sleeping on the water,
       They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,
     And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,
       Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind
     Proved even still a more nutritious matter,
       Because it left encouragement behind:
     They thought that in such perils, more than chance
     Had sent them this for their deliverance.
     The land appear'd a high and rocky coast,
       And higher grew the mountains as they drew,
     Set by a current, toward it: they were lost
       In various conjectures, for none knew
     To what part of the earth they had been tost,
       So changeable had been the winds that blew;
     Some thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,
     Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.
     Meantime the current, with a rising gale,
       Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,
     Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:
       Their living freight was now reduced to four,
     And three dead, whom their strength could not avail
       To heave into the deep with those before,
     Though the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd
     The spray into their faces as they splash'd.
     Famine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat, had done
       Their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to
     Such things a mother had not known her son
       Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;
     By night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one
       They perish'd, until wither'd to these few,
     But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,
     In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.
     As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen
       Unequal in its aspect here and there,
     They felt the freshness of its growing green,
       That waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,
     And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
       From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare—
     Lovely seem'd any object that should sweep
     Away the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.
     The shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,
       And girt by formidable waves; but they
     Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,
       Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:
     A reef between them also now began
       To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,
     But finding no place for their landing better,
     They ran the boat for shore,—and overset her.
     But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,
       Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;
     And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,
       Had often turn'd the art to some account:
     A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,
       He could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,
     As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)
     Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.
     So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,
       He buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply
     With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,
       The beach which lay before him, high and dry:
     The greatest danger here was from a shark,
       That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;
     As for the other two, they could not swim,
     So nobody arrived on shore but him.
     Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,
       Which, providentially for him, was wash'd
     Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,
       And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd
     Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore
       The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;
     At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he
     Roll'd on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:
     There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung
       Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,
     From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,
       Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
     And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,
       Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,
     With just enough of life to feel its pain,
     And deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.
     With slow and staggering effort he arose,
       But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
     And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those
       Who long had been his mates upon the sea;
     But none of them appear'd to share his woes,
       Save one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,
     Who died two days before, and now had found
     An unknown barren beach for burial ground.
     And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,
       And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand
     Swam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:
       He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand
     Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),
       And, like a wither'd lily, on the land
     His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,
     As fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.
     How long in his damp trance young Juan lay
       He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,
     And Time had nothing more of night nor day
       For his congealing blood, and senses dim;
     And how this heavy faintness pass'd away
       He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,
     And tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,
     For Death, though vanquish'd, still retired with strife.
     His eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,
       For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought
     He still was in the boat and had but dozed,
       And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,
     And wish'd it death in which he had reposed;
       And then once more his feelings back were brought,
     And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
     A lovely female face of seventeen.
     'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth
       Seem'd almost prying into his for breath;
     And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth
       Recall'd his answering spirits back from death;
     And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe
       Each pulse to animation, till beneath
     Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh
     To these kind efforts made a low reply.
     Then was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung
       Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm
     Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;
       And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,
     Pillow'd his death-like forehead; then she wrung
       His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;
     And watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew
     A sigh from his heaved bosom—and hers, too.
     And lifting him with care into the cave,
       The gentle girl and her attendant,—one
     Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,
       And more robust of figure,—then begun
     To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave
       Light to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun
     Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er
     She was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.
     Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,
       That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair—
     Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd
       In braids behind; and though her stature were
     Even of the highest for a female mould,
       They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air
     There was a something which bespoke command,
     As one who was a lady in the land.
     Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
       Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,
     Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies
       Deepest attraction; for when to the view
     Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,
       Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
     'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,
     And hurls at once his venom and his strength.
     Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye
       Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
     Short upper lip—sweet lips! that make us sigh
       Ever to have seen such; for she was one
     Fit for the model of a statuary
       (A race of mere impostors, when all 's done—
     I 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,
     Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).
     I 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just
       One should not rail without a decent cause:
     There was an Irish lady, to whose bust
       I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was
     A frequent model; and if e'er she must
       Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,
     They will destroy a face which mortal thought
     Ne'er compass'd, nor less mortal chisel wrought.
     And such was she, the lady of the cave:
       Her dress was very different from the Spanish,
     Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;
       For, as you know, the Spanish women banish
     Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave
       Around them (what I hope will never vanish)
     The basquina and the mantilla, they
     Seem at the same time mystical and gay.
     But with our damsel this was not the case:
       Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;
     Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,
       But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
     Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
       Flow'd in her veil, and many a precious stone
     Flash'd on her little hand; but, what was shocking,
     Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.
     The other female's dress was not unlike,
       But of inferior materials: she
     Had not so many ornaments to strike,
       Her hair had silver only, bound to be
     Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
       Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;
     Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes
     As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.
     And these two tended him, and cheer'd him both
       With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,
     Which are (as I must own) of female growth,
       And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
     They made a most superior mess of broth,
       A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,
     But the best dish that e'er was cook'd since Homer's
     Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.
     I 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,
       Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;
     Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air
       Of clap-trap which your recent poets prize;
     And so, in short, the girls they really were
       They shall appear before your curious eyes,
     Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter
     Of an old man who lived upon the water.
     A fisherman he had been in his youth,
       And still a sort of fisherman was he;
     But other speculations were, in sooth,
       Added to his connection with the sea,
     Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:
       A little smuggling, and some piracy,
     Left him, at last, the sole of many masters
     Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.
     A fisher, therefore, was he,—though of men,
       Like Peter the Apostle,—and he fish'd
     For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,
       And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;
     The cargoes he confiscated, and gain
       He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd
     Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,
     By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.
     He was a Greek, and on his isle had built
       (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)
     A very handsome house from out his guilt,
       And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
     Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,
       A sad old fellow was he, if you please;
     But this I know, it was a spacious building,
     Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.
     He had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,
       The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;
     Besides, so very beautiful was she,
       Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
     Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree
       She grew to womanhood, and between whiles
     Rejected several suitors, just to learn
     How to accept a better in his turn.
		 
Frontispiece
     And walking out upon the beach, below
       The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,
     Insensible,—not dead, but nearly so,—
       Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;
     But being naked, she was shock'd, you know,
       Yet deem'd herself in common pity bound,
     As far as in her lay, 'to take him in,
     A stranger' dying, with so white a skin.
     But taking him into her father's house
       Was not exactly the best way to save,
     But like conveying to the cat the mouse,
       Or people in a trance into their grave;
     Because the good old man had so much 'nous,'
       Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,
     He would have hospitably cured the stranger,
     And sold him instantly when out of danger.
     And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best
       (A virgin always on her maid relies)
     To place him in the cave for present rest:
       And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,
     Their charity increased about their guest;
       And their compassion grew to such a size,
     It open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven
     (St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).
     They made a fire,—but such a fire as they
       Upon the moment could contrive with such
     Materials as were cast up round the bay,—
       Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch
     Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay
       A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;
     But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,
     That there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.
     He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,
       For Haidee stripped her sables off to make
     His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,
       And warm, in case by chance he should awake,
     They also gave a petticoat apiece,
       She and her maid—and promised by daybreak
     To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish
     For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.
     And thus they left him to his lone repose:
       Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,
     Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),
       Just for the present; and in his lull'd head
     Not even a vision of his former woes
       Throbb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread
     Unwelcome visions of our former years,
     Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.
     Young Juan slept all dreamless:—but the maid,
       Who smooth'd his pillow, as she left the den
     Look'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,
       And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.
     He slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said
       (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),
     He had pronounced her name—but she forgot
     That at this moment Juan knew it not.
     And pensive to her father's house she went,
       Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who
     Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,
       She being wiser by a year or two:
     A year or two 's an age when rightly spent,
       And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,
     In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
     Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.
     The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still
       Fast in his cave, and nothing clash'd upon
     His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,
       And the young beams of the excluded sun,
     Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;
       And need he had of slumber yet, for none
     Had suffer'd more—his hardships were comparative
     To those related in my grand-dad's 'Narrative.'
     Not so Haidee: she sadly toss'd and tumbled,
       And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er
     Dream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,
       And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;
     And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,
       And call'd her father's old slaves up, who swore
     In several oaths—Armenian, Turk, and Greek—
     They knew not what to think of such a freak.
     But up she got, and up she made them get,
       With some pretence about the sun, that makes
     Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;
       And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks
     Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet
       With mist, and every bird with him awakes,
     And night is flung off like a mourning suit
     Worn for a husband,—or some other brute.
     I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,
       I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late
     I have sat up on purpose all the night,
       Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;
     And so all ye, who would be in the right
       In health and purse, begin your day to date
     From daybreak, and when coffin'd at fourscore,
     Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.
     And Haidee met the morning face to face;
       Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush
     Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race
       From heart to cheek is curb'd into a blush,
     Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,
       That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,
     Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;
     Or the Red Sea—but the sea is not red.
     And down the cliff the island virgin came,
       And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,
     While the sun smiled on her with his first flame,
       And young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,
     Taking her for a sister; just the same
       Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,
     Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,
     Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.
     And when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd
       All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw
     That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;
       And then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe
     (For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept
       And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,
     Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as death
     Bent with hush'd lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.
     And thus like to an angel o'er the dying
       Who die in righteousness, she lean'd; and there
     All tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,
       As o'er him the calm and stirless air:
     But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,
       Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair
     Must breakfast—and betimes, lest they should ask it,
     She drew out her provision from the basket.
     She knew that the best feelings must have victual,
       And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;
     Besides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,
       And felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;
     And so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;
       I can't say that she gave them any tea,
     But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,
     With Scio wine,—and all for love, not money.
     And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and
       The coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;
     But Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,
       And without word, a sign her finger drew on
     Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;
       And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,
     Because her mistress would not let her break
     That sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.
     For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek
       A purple hectic play'd like dying day
     On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak
       Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,
     Where the blue veins look'd shadowy, shrunk, and weak;
       And his black curls were dewy with the spray,
     Which weigh'd upon them yet, all damp and salt,
     Mix'd with the stony vapours of the vault.
     And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,
       Hush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,
     Droop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,
       Lull'd like the depth of ocean when at rest,
     Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,
       Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;
     In short, he was a very pretty fellow,
     Although his woes had turn'd him rather yellow.
     He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,
       But the fair face which met his eyes forbade
     Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain
       Had further sleep a further pleasure made;
     For woman's face was never form'd in vain
       For Juan, so that even when he pray'd
     He turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,
     To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.
     And thus upon his elbow he arose,
       And look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek
     The pale contended with the purple rose,
       As with an effort she began to speak;
     Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,
       Although she told him, in good modern Greek,
     With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,
     That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.
     Now Juan could not understand a word,
       Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,
     And her voice was the warble of a bird,
       So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,
     That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;
       The sort of sound we echo with a tear,
     Without knowing why—an overpowering tone,
     Whence Melody descends as from a throne.
     And Juan gazed as one who is awoke
       By a distant organ, doubting if he be
     Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke
       By the watchman, or some such reality,
     Or by one's early valet's cursed knock;
       At least it is a heavy sound to me,
     Who like a morning slumber—for the night
     Shows stars and women in a better light.
     And Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,
       Or sleep, or whatso'er it was, by feeling
     A most prodigious appetite: the steam
       Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing
     Upon his senses, and the kindling beam
       Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling
     To stir her viands, made him quite awake
     And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.
     But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
       Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;
     And, when a holiday upon them smiles,
       A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:
     But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,
       For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;
     Others are fair and fertile, among which
     This, though not large, was one of the most rich.
     I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking
       That the old fable of the Minotaur—
     From which our modern morals rightly shrinking
       Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore
     A cow's shape for a mask—was only (sinking
       The allegory) a mere type, no more,
     That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,
     To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.
     For we all know that English people are
       Fed upon beef—I won't say much of beer,
     Because 't is liquor only, and being far
       From this my subject, has no business here;
     We know, too, they very fond of war,
       A pleasure—like all pleasures—rather dear;
     So were the Cretans—from which I infer
     That beef and battles both were owing to her.
     But to resume. The languid Juan raised
       His head upon his elbow, and he saw
     A sight on which he had not lately gazed,
       As all his latter meals had been quite raw,
     Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,
       And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,
     He fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like
     A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.
     He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,
       Who watch'd him like a mother, would have fed
     Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see
       Such appetite in one she had deem'd dead;
     But Zoe, being older than Haidee,
       Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)
     That famish'd people must be slowly nurst,
     And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.
     And so she took the liberty to state,
       Rather by deeds than words, because the case
     Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate
       Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
     The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,
       Unless he wish'd to die upon the place—
     She snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,
     Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.
     Next they—he being naked, save a tatter'd
       Pair of scarce decent trowsers—went to work,
     And in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,
       And dress'd him, for the present, like a Turk,
     Or Greek—that is, although it not much matter'd,
       Omitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,—
     They furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,
     With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.
     And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,
       But not a word could Juan comprehend,
     Although he listen'd so that the young Greek in
       Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
     And, as he interrupted not, went eking
       Her speech out to her protege and friend,
     Till pausing at the last her breath to take,
     She saw he did not understand Romaic.
     And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,
       And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,
     And read (the only book she could) the lines
       Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,
     The answer eloquent, where soul shines
       And darts in one quick glance a long reply;
     And thus in every look she saw exprest
     A world of words, and things at which she guess'd.
     And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,
       And words repeated after her, he took
     A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,
       No doubt, less of her language than her look:
     As he who studies fervently the skies
       Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,
     Thus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better
     From Haidee's glance than any graven letter.
     'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue
       By female lips and eyes—that is, I mean,
     When both the teacher and the taught are young,
       As was the case, at least, where I have been;
     They smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong
       They smile still more, and then there intervene
     Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;—
     I learn'd the little that I know by this:
     That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,
       Italian not at all, having no teachers;
     Much English I cannot pretend to speak,
       Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,
     Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week
       I study, also Blair, the highest reachers
     Of eloquence in piety and prose—
     I hate your poets, so read none of those.
     As for the ladies, I have nought to say,
       A wanderer from the British world of fashion,
     Where I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'
       Like other men, too, may have had my passion—
     But that, like other things, has pass'd away,
       And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:
     Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me
     But dreams of what has been, no more to be.
     Return we to Don Juan. He begun
       To hear new words, and to repeat them; but
     Some feelings, universal as the sun,
       Were such as could not in his breast be shut
     More than within the bosom of a nun:
       He was in love,—as you would be, no doubt,
     With a young benefactress,—so was she,
     Just in the way we very often see.
     And every day by daybreak—rather early
       For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest—
     She came into the cave, but it was merely
       To see her bird reposing in his nest;
     And she would softly stir his locks so curly,
       Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,
     Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,
     As o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.
     And every morn his colour freshlier came,
       And every day help'd on his convalescence;
     'T was well, because health in the human frame
       Is pleasant, besides being true love's essence,
     For health and idleness to passion's flame
       Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons
     Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,
     Without whom Venus will not long attack us.
     While Venus fills the heart (without heart really
       Love, though good always, is not quite so good),
     Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,—
       For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,—
     While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:
       Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;
     But who is their purveyor from above
     Heaven knows,—it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.
     When Juan woke he found some good things ready,
       A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes
     That ever made a youthful heart less steady,
       Besides her maid's as pretty for their size;
     But I have spoken of all this already—
       And repetition 's tiresome and unwise,—
     Well—Juan, after bathing in the sea,
     Came always back to coffee and Haidee.
     Both were so young, and one so innocent,
       That bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd
     To her, as 'twere, the kind of being sent,
       Of whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,
     A something to be loved, a creature meant
       To be her happiness, and whom she deem'd
     To render happy; all who joy would win
     Must share it,—Happiness was born a twin.
     It was such pleasure to behold him, such
       Enlargement of existence to partake
     Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,
       To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:
     To live with him forever were too much;
       But then the thought of parting made her quake;
     He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast
     Like a rich wreck—her first love, and her last.
     And thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee
       Paid daily visits to her boy, and took
     Such plentiful precautions, that still he
       Remain'd unknown within his craggy nook;
     At last her father's prows put out to sea
       For certain merchantmen upon the look,
     Not as of yore to carry off an Io,
     But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.
     Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,
       So that, her father being at sea, she was
     Free as a married woman, or such other
       Female, as where she likes may freely pass,
     Without even the incumbrance of a brother,
       The freest she that ever gazed on glass;
     I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,
     Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.
     Now she prolong'd her visits and her talk
       (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say
     So much as to propose to take a walk,—
       For little had he wander'd since the day
     On which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,
       Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,—
     And thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,
     And saw the sun set opposite the moon.
     It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,
       With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,
     Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,
       With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore
     A better welcome to the tempest-tost;
       And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,
     Save on the dead long summer days, which make
     The outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.
     And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
       Scarcely o'erpass'd the cream of your champagne,
     When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,
       That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!
     Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach
       Who please,—the more because they preach in vain,—
     Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,
     Sermons and soda-water the day after.
     Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;
       The best of life is but intoxication:
     Glory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk
       The hopes of all men, and of every nation;
     Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk
       Of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:
     But to return,—Get very drunk; and when
     You wake with headache, you shall see what then.
     Ring for your valet—bid him quickly bring
       Some hock and soda-water, then you 'll know
     A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;
       For not the bless'd sherbet, sublimed with snow,
     Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,
       Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,
     After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,
     Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water.
     The coast—I think it was the coast that
       Was just describing—Yes, it was the coast—
     Lay at this period quiet as the sky,
       The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,
     And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,
       And dolphin's leap, and little billow crost
     By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret
     Against the boundary it scarcely wet.
     And forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,
       As I have said, upon an expedition;
     And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,
       Save Zoe, who, although with due precision
     She waited on her lady with the sun,
       Thought daily service was her only mission,
     Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,
     And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.
     It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded
       Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,
     Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,
       Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,
     With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded
       On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill
     Upon the other, and the rosy sky,
     With one star sparkling through it like an eye.
     And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,
       Over the shining pebbles and the shells,
     Glided along the smooth and harden'd sand,
       And in the worn and wild receptacles
     Work'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd,
       In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,
     They turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,
     Yielded to the deep twilight's purple charm.
     They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow
       Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;
     They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
       Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;
     They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,
       And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
     Into each other—and, beholding this,
     Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;
     A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,
       And beauty, all concentrating like rays
     Into one focus, kindled from above;
       Such kisses as belong to early days,
     Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,
       And the blood 's lava, and the pulse a blaze,
     Each kiss a heart-quake,—for a kiss's strength,
     I think, it must be reckon'd by its length.
     By length I mean duration; theirs endured
       Heaven knows how long—no doubt they never reckon'd;
     And if they had, they could not have secured
       The sum of their sensations to a second:
     They had not spoken; but they felt allured,
       As if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,
     Which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung—
     Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.
     They were alone, but not alone as they
       Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;
     The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,
       The twilight glow which momently grew less,
     The voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay
       Around them, made them to each other press,
     As if there were no life beneath the sky
     Save theirs, and that their life could never die.
     They fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,
       They felt no terrors from the night, they were
     All in all to each other: though their speech
       Was broken words, they thought a language there,—
     And all the burning tongues the passions teach
       Found in one sigh the best interpreter
     Of nature's oracle—first love,—that all
     Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.
     Haidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,
       Nor offer'd any; she had never heard
     Of plight and promises to be a spouse,
       Or perils by a loving maid incurr'd;
     She was all which pure ignorance allows,
       And flew to her young mate like a young bird;
     And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she
     Had not one word to say of constancy.
     She loved, and was beloved—she adored,
       And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,
     Their intense souls, into each other pour'd,
       If souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,—
     But by degrees their senses were restored,
       Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;
     And, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart
     Felt as if never more to beat apart.
     Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,
       So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour
     Was that in which the heart is always full,
       And, having o'er itself no further power,
     Prompts deeds eternity can not annul,
       But pays off moments in an endless shower
     Of hell-fire—all prepared for people giving
     Pleasure or pain to one another living.
     Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were
       So loving and so lovely—till then never,
     Excepting our first parents, such a pair
       Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;
     And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,
       Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,
     And hell and purgatory—but forgot
     Just in the very crisis she should not.
     They look upon each other, and their eyes
       Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps
     Round Juan's head, and his around her lies
       Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;
     She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,
       He hers, until they end in broken gasps;
     And thus they form a group that 's quite antique,
     Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.
     And when those deep and burning moments pass'd,
       And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,
     She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,
       Sustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;
     And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,
       And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,
     Pillow'd on her o'erflowing heart, which pants
     With all it granted, and with all it grants.
     An infant when it gazes on a light,
       A child the moment when it drains the breast,
     A devotee when soars the Host in sight,
       An Arab with a stranger for a guest,
     A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,
       A miser filling his most hoarded chest,
     Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping
     As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.
     For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,
       All that it hath of life with us is living;
     So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,
       And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;
     All it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,
       Hush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:
     There lies the thing we love with all its errors
     And all its charms, like death without its terrors.
     The lady watch'd her lover—and that hour
       Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,
     O'erflow'd her soul with their united power;
       Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude
     She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,
       Where nought upon their passion could intrude,
     And all the stars that crowded the blue space
     Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.
     Alas! the love of women! it is known
       To be a lovely and a fearful thing;
     For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,
       And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring
     To them but mockeries of the past alone,
       And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,
     Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real
     Torture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.
     They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,
       Is always so to women; one sole bond
     Awaits them, treachery is all their trust;
       Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond
     Over their idol, till some wealthier lust
       Buys them in marriage—and what rests beyond?
     A thankless husband, next a faithless lover,
     Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.
     Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,
       Some mind their household, others dissipation,
     Some run away, and but exchange their cares,
       Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;
     Few changes e'er can better their affairs,
       Theirs being an unnatural situation,
     From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:
     Some play the devil, and then write a novel.
     Haidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;
       Haidee was Passion's child, born where the sun
     Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss
       Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one
     Made but to love, to feel that she was his
       Who was her chosen: what was said or done
     Elsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,
     Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.
     And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!
       How much it costs us! yet each rising throb
     Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,
       That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob
     Joy of its alchymy, and to repeat
       Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job
     To make us understand each good old maxim,
     So good—I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.
     And now 't was done—on the lone shore were plighted
       Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed
     Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:
       Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,
     By their own feelings hallow'd and united,
       Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:
     And they were happy, for to their young eyes
     Each was an angel, and earth paradise.
     O, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,
       Titus the master, Antony the slave,
     Horace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,
       Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave
     All those may leap who rather would be neuter
       (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)—
     O, Love! thou art the very god of evil,
     For, after all, we cannot call thee devil.
     Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,
       And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:
     Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,
       Have much employ'd the muse of history's pen;
     Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,
       Such worthies Time will never see again;
     Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,
     They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.
     Thou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus
       And Aristippus, a material crew!
     Who to immoral courses would allure us
       By theories quite practicable too;
     If only from the devil they would insure us,
       How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),
     'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'
     So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.
     But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?
       And should he have forgotten her so soon?
     I can't but say it seems to me most truly
       Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon
     Does these things for us, and whenever newly
       Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,
     Else how the devil is it that fresh features
     Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?
     I hate inconstancy—I loathe, detest,
       Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made
     Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast
       No permanent foundation can be laid;
     Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,
       And yet last night, being at a masquerade,
     I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,
     Which gave me some sensations like a villain.
     But soon Philosophy came to my aid,
       And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'
     'I will, my dear Philosophy!' I said,
       'But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!
     I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,
       Or neither—out of curiosity.'
     'Stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian
     (Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);
     'Stop!' so I stopp'd.—But to return: that which
       Men call inconstancy is nothing more
     Than admiration due where nature's rich
       Profusion with young beauty covers o'er
     Some favour'd object; and as in the niche
       A lovely statue we almost adore,
     This sort of adoration of the real
     Is but a heightening of the 'beau ideal.'
     'T is the perception of the beautiful,
       A fine extension of the faculties,
     Platonic, universal, wonderful,
       Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,
     Without which life would be extremely dull;
       In short, it is the use of our own eyes,
     With one or two small senses added, just
     To hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.
     Yet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,
       For surely if we always could perceive
     In the same object graces quite as killing
       As when she rose upon us like an Eve,
     'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling
       (For we must get them any how or grieve),
     Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,
     How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!
     The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,
       But changes night and day, too, like the sky;
     Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,
       And darkness and destruction as on high:
     But when it hath been scorch'd, and pierced, and riven,
       Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye
     Pours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,
     Which make the English climate of our years.
     The liver is the lazaret of bile,
       But very rarely executes its function,
     For the first passion stays there such a while,
       That all the rest creep in and form a junction,
     Life knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,—
       Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,—
     So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,
     Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'
     In the mean time, without proceeding more
       In this anatomy, I 've finish'd now
     Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,
       That being about the number I 'll allow
     Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;
       And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
     Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead
     For them and theirs with all who deign to read.
Canto 3
CANTO THE THIRD.
     Hail, Muse! et cetera.—We left Juan sleeping,
       Pillow'd upon a fair and happy breast,
     And watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,
       And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest
     To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,
       Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,
     Had soil'd the current of her sinless years,
     And turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!
     O, Love! what is it in this world of ours
       Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why
     With cypress branches hast thou Wreathed thy bowers,
       And made thy best interpreter a sigh?
     As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,
       And place them on their breast—but place to die—
     Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish
     Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.
     In her first passion woman loves her lover,
       In all the others all she loves is love,
     Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,
       And fits her loosely—like an easy glove,
     As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:
       One man alone at first her heart can move;
     She then prefers him in the plural number,
     Not finding that the additions much encumber.
     I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;
       But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted
     (Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)
       After a decent time must be gallanted;
     Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs
       Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;
     Yet there are some, they say, who have had none,
     But those who have ne'er end with only one.
     'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign
       Of human frailty, folly, also crime,
     That love and marriage rarely can combine,
       Although they both are born in the same clime;
     Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine—
       A sad, sour, sober beverage—by time
     Is sharpen'd from its high celestial flavour
     Down to a very homely household savour.
     There 's something of antipathy, as 't were,
       Between their present and their future state;
     A kind of flattery that 's hardly fair
       Is used until the truth arrives too late—
     Yet what can people do, except despair?
       The same things change their names at such a rate;
     For instance—passion in a lover 's glorious,
     But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.
     Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;
       They sometimes also get a little tired
     (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:
       The same things cannot always be admired,
     Yet 't is 'so nominated in the bond,'
       That both are tied till one shall have expired.
     Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning
     Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.
     There 's doubtless something in domestic doings
       Which forms, in fact, true love's antithesis;
     Romances paint at full length people's wooings,
       But only give a bust of marriages;
     For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,
       There 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:
     Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
     He would have written sonnets all his life?
     All tragedies are finish'd by a death,
       All comedies are ended by a marriage;
     The future states of both are left to faith,
       For authors fear description might disparage
     The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,
       And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;
     So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,
     They say no more of Death or of the Lady.
     The only two that in my recollection
       Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are
     Dante and Milton, and of both the affection
       Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar
     Of fault or temper ruin'd the connection
       (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar):
     But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve
     Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.
     Some persons say that Dante meant theology
       By Beatrice, and not a mistress—I,
     Although my opinion may require apology,
       Deem this a commentator's fantasy,
     Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he
       Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;
     I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics
     Meant to personify the mathematics.
     Haidee and Juan were not married, but
       The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,
     Chaste reader, then, in any way to put
       The blame on me, unless you wish they were;
     Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut
       The book which treats of this erroneous pair,
     Before the consequences grow too awful;
     'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.
     Yet they were happy,—happy in the illicit
       Indulgence of their innocent desires;
     But more imprudent grown with every visit,
       Haidee forgot the island was her sire's;
     When we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,
       At least in the beginning, ere one tires;
     Thus she came often, not a moment losing,
     Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.
     Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,
       Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,
     For into a prime minister but change
       His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;
     But he, more modest, took an humbler range
       Of life, and in an honester vocation
     Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,
     And merely practised as a sea-attorney.
     The good old gentleman had been detain'd
       By winds and waves, and some important captures;
     And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,
       Although a squall or two had damp'd his raptures,
     By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd
       His prisoners, dividing them like chapters
     In number'd lots; they all had cuffs and collars,
     And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.
     Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,
       Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold
     To his Tunis correspondents, save one man
       Toss'd overboard unsaleable (being old);
     The rest—save here and there some richer one,
       Reserved for future ransom—in the hold
     Were link'd alike, as for the common people he
     Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.
     The merchandise was served in the same way,
       Pieced out for different marts in the Levant;
     Except some certain portions of the prey,
       Light classic articles of female want,
     French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,
       Guitars and castanets from Alicant,
     All which selected from the spoil he gathers,
     Robb'd for his daughter by the best of fathers.
     A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,
       Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,
     He chose from several animals he saw—
       A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,
     Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,
       The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;
     These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
     He caged in one huge hamper altogether.
     Then having settled his marine affairs,
       Despatching single cruisers here and there,
     His vessel having need of some repairs,
       He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
     Continued still her hospitable cares;
       But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,
     And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
     His port lay on the other side o' the isle.
     And there he went ashore without delay,
       Having no custom-house nor quarantine
     To ask him awkward questions on the way
       About the time and place where he had been:
     He left his ship to be hove down next day,
       With orders to the people to careen;
     So that all hands were busy beyond measure,
     In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.
     Arriving at the summit of a hill
       Which overlook'd the white walls of his home,
     He stopp'd.—What singular emotions fill
       Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!
     With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill—
       With love for many, and with fears for some;
     All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,
     And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.
     The approach of home to husbands and to sires,
       After long travelling by land or water,
     Most naturally some small doubt inspires—
       A female family 's a serious matter
     (None trusts the sex more, or so much admires—
       But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);
     Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,
     And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.
     An honest gentleman at his return
       May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;
     Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,
       Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;
     The odds are that he finds a handsome urn
       To his memory—and two or three young misses
     Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,—
     And that his Argus—bites him by the breeches.
     If single, probably his plighted fair
       Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;
     But all the better, for the happy pair
       May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,
     He may resume his amatory care
       As cavalier servente, or despise her;
     And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,
     Write odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.
     And oh! ye gentlemen who have already
       Some chaste liaison of the kind—I mean
     An honest friendship with a married lady—
       The only thing of this sort ever seen
     To last—of all connections the most steady,
       And the true Hymen (the first 's but a screen)—
     Yet for all that keep not too long away,
     I 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.
     Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had
       Much less experience of dry land than ocean,
     On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;
       But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion
     Of the true reason of his not being sad,
       Or that of any other strong emotion;
     He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,
     But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.
     He saw his white walls shining in the sun,
       His garden trees all shadowy and green;
     He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,
       The distant dog-bark; and perceived between
     The umbrage of the wood so cool and dun
       The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen
     Of arms (in the East all arm)—and various dyes
     Of colour'd garbs, as bright as butterflies.
     And as the spot where they appear he nears,
       Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,
     He hears—alas! no music of the spheres,
       But an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!
     A melody which made him doubt his ears,
       The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;
     A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,
     A most unoriental roar of laughter.
     And still more nearly to the place advancing,
       Descending rather quickly the declivity,
     Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,
       'Midst other indications of festivity,
     Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing
       Like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he
     Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,
     To which the Levantines are very partial.
     And further on a group of Grecian girls,
       The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,
     Were strung together like a row of pearls,
       Link'd hand in hand, and dancing; each too having
     Down her white neck long floating auburn curls
       (The least of which would set ten poets raving);
     Their leader sang—and bounded to her song,
     With choral step and voice, the virgin throng.
     And here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,
       Small social parties just begun to dine;
     Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,
       And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,
     And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;
       Above them their dessert grew on its vine,
     The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er
     Dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.
     A band of children, round a snow-white ram,
       There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;
     While peaceful as if still an unwean'd lamb,
       The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers
     His sober head, majestically tame,
       Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers
     His brow, as if in act to butt, and then
     Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.
     Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,
       Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,
     Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,
       The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,
     The innocence which happy childhood blesses,
       Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;
     So that the philosophical beholder
     Sigh'd for their sakes—that they should e'er grow older.
     Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales
       To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,
     Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,
       Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,
     Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,
       Of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,
     Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,
     Transform'd their lords to beasts (but that 's a fact).
     Here was no lack of innocent diversion
       For the imagination or the senses,
     Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,
       All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;
     But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,
       Perceiving in his absence such expenses,
     Dreading that climax of all human ills,
     The inflammation of his weekly bills.
     Ah! what is man? what perils still environ
       The happiest mortals even after dinner—
     A day of gold from out an age of iron
       Is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;
     Pleasure (whene'er she sings, at least) 's a siren,
       That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;
     Lambro's reception at his people's banquet
     Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.
     He—being a man who seldom used a word
       Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise
     (In general he surprised men with the sword)
       His daughter—had not sent before to advise
     Of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;
       And long he paused to re-assure his eyes
     In fact much more astonish'd than delighted,
     To find so much good company invited.
     He did not know (alas! how men will lie)
       That a report (especially the Greeks)
     Avouch'd his death (such people never die),
       And put his house in mourning several weeks,—
     But now their eyes and also lips were dry;
       The bloom, too, had return'd to Haidee's cheeks,
     Her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,
     She now kept house upon her own account.
     Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,
       Which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;
     The servants all were getting drunk or idling,
       A life which made them happy beyond measure.
     Her father's hospitality seem'd middling,
       Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;
     'T was wonderful how things went on improving,
     While she had not one hour to spare from loving.
     Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast
       He flew into a passion, and in fact
     There was no mighty reason to be pleased;
       Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,
     The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,
       To teach his people to be more exact,
     And that, proceeding at a very high rate,
     He show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.
     You 're wrong.—He was the mildest manner'd man
       That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:
     With such true breeding of a gentleman,
       You never could divine his real thought;
     No courtier could, and scarcely woman can
       Gird more deceit within a petticoat;
     Pity he loved adventurous life's variety,
     He was so great a loss to good society.
     Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,
       Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,
     With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,
       Boded no good, whatever it express'd,
     He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;
       The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd
     His question, much too merry to divine
     The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,
     And without turning his facetious head,
       Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,
     Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,
       'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'
     A second hiccup'd, 'Our old master 's dead,
       You 'd better ask our mistress who 's his heir.'
     'Our mistress!' quoth a third: 'Our mistress!—pooh!-
     You mean our master—not the old, but new.'
     These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom
       They thus address'd—and Lambro's visage fell—
     And o'er his eye a momentary gloom
       Pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell
     The expression, and endeavouring to resume
       His smile, requested one of them to tell
     The name and quality of his new patron,
     Who seem'd to have turn'd Haidee into a matron.
     'I know not,' quoth the fellow, 'who or what
       He is, nor whence he came—and little care;
     But this I know, that this roast capon 's fat,
       And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;
     And if you are not satisfied with that,
       Direct your questions to my neighbour there;
     He 'll answer all for better or for worse,
     For none likes more to hear himself converse.'
     I said that Lambro was a man of patience,
       And certainly he show'd the best of breeding,
     Which scarce even France, the paragon of nations,
       E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;
     He bore these sneers against his near relations,
       His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,
     The insults, too, of every servile glutton,
     Who all the time was eating up his mutton.
     Now in a person used to much command—
       To bid men come, and go, and come again—
     To see his orders done, too, out of hand—
       Whether the word was death, or but the chain—
     It may seem strange to find his manners bland;
       Yet such things are, which I can not explain,
     Though doubtless he who can command himself
     Is good to govern—almost as a Guelf.
     Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,
       But never in his real and serious mood;
     Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,
       He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;
     With him it never was a word and blow,
       His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,
     But in his silence there was much to rue,
     And his one blow left little work for two.
     He ask'd no further questions, and proceeded
       On to the house, but by a private way,
     So that the few who met him hardly heeded,
       So little they expected him that day;
     If love paternal in his bosom pleaded
       For Haidee's sake, is more than I can say,
     But certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,
     This revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning.
     If all the dead could now return to life
       (Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,
     For instance, if a husband or his wife
       (Nuptial examples are as good as any),
     No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,
       The present weather would be much more rainy—
     Tears shed into the grave of the connection
     Would share most probably its resurrection.
     He enter'd in the house no more his home,
       A thing to human feelings the most trying,
     And harder for the heart to overcome,
       Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;
     To find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,
       And round its once warm precincts palely lying
     The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,
     Beyond a single gentleman's belief.
     He enter'd in the house—his home no more,
       For without hearts there is no home; and felt
     The solitude of passing his own door
       Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,
     There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,
       There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt
     Over the innocence of that sweet child,
     His only shrine of feelings undefiled.
     He was a man of a strange temperament,
       Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,
     Moderate in all his habits, and content
       With temperance in pleasure, as in food,
     Quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant
       For something better, if not wholly good;
     His country's wrongs and his despair to save her
     Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.
     The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,
       The hardness by long habitude produced,
     The dangerous life in which he had grown old,
       The mercy he had granted oft abused,
     The sights he was accustom'd to behold,
       The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,
     Had cost his enemies a long repentance,
     And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.
     But something of the spirit of old Greece
       Flash'd o'er his soul a few heroic rays,
     Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece
       His predecessors in the Colchian days;
     T is true he had no ardent love for peace—
       Alas! his country show'd no path to praise:
     Hate to the world and war with every nation
     He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.
     Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime
       Shed its Ionian elegance, which show'd
     Its power unconsciously full many a time,—
       A taste seen in the choice of his abode,
     A love of music and of scenes sublime,
       A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd
     Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,
     Bedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours.
     But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed
       On that beloved daughter; she had been
     The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
       Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;
     A lonely pure affection unopposed:
       There wanted but the loss of this to wean
     His feelings from all milk of human kindness,
     And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.
     The cubless tigress in her jungle raging
       Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;
     The ocean when its yeasty war is waging
       Is awful to the vessel near the rock;
     But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,
       Their fury being spent by its own shock,
     Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire
     Of a strong human heart, and in a sire.
     It is a hard although a common case
       To find our children running restive—they
     In whom our brightest days we would retrace,
       Our little selves re-form'd in finer clay,
     Just as old age is creeping on apace,
       And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,
     They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,
     But in good company—the gout or stone.
     Yet a fine family is a fine thing
       (Provided they don't come in after dinner);
     'T is beautiful to see a matron bring
       Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);
     Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling
       To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).
     A lady with her daughters or her nieces
     Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.
     Old Lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,
       And stood within his hall at eventide;
     Meantime the lady and her lover sate
       At wassail in their beauty and their pride:
     An ivory inlaid table spread with state
       Before them, and fair slaves on every side;
     Gems, gold, and silver, form'd the service mostly,
     Mother of pearl and coral the less costly.
     The dinner made about a hundred dishes;
       Lamb and pistachio nuts—in short, all meats,
     And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes
       Were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,
     Drest to a Sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;
       The beverage was various sherbets
     Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,
     Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.
     These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,
       And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,
     And Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,
       In small fine China cups, came in at last;
     Gold cups of filigree made to secure
       The hand from burning underneath them placed,
     Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil'd
     Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoil'd.
     The hangings of the room were tapestry, made
       Of velvet panels, each of different hue,
     And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;
       And round them ran a yellow border too;
     The upper border, richly wrought, display'd,
       Embroider'd delicately o'er with blue,
     Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,
     From poets, or the moralists their betters.
     These Oriental writings on the wall,
       Quite common in those countries, are a kind
     Of monitors adapted to recall,
       Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind
     The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,
       And took his kingdom from him: You will find,
     Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,
     There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.
     A beauty at the season's close grown hectic,
       A genius who has drunk himself to death,
     A rake turn'd methodistic, or Eclectic
       (For that 's the name they like to pray beneath)—
     But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,
       Are things that really take away the breath,—
     And show that late hours, wine, and love are able
     To do not much less damage than the table.
     Haidee and Juan carpeted their feet
       On crimson satin, border'd with pale blue;
     Their sofa occupied three parts complete
       Of the apartment—and appear'd quite new;
     The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)
       Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew
     A sun emboss'd in gold, whose rays of tissue,
     Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.
     Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,
       Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats
     And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,
       Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,
     And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain
       Their bread as ministers and favourites (that 's
     To say, by degradation) mingled there
     As plentiful as in a court, or fair.
     There was no want of lofty mirrors, and
       The tables, most of ebony inlaid
     With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,
       Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,
     Fretted with gold or silver:—by command,
       The greater part of these were ready spread
     With viands and sherbets in ice—and wine—
     Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.
     Of all the dresses I select Haidee's:
       She wore two jelicks—one was of pale yellow;
     Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise—
       'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;
     With buttons form'd of pearls as large as peas,
       All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,
     And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,
     Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her.
     One large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,
       Lockless—so pliable from the pure gold
     That the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,
       The limb which it adorn'd its only mould;
     So beautiful—its very shape would charm;
       And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,
     The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin
     That e'er by precious metal was held in.
     Around, as princess of her father's land,
       A like gold bar above her instep roll'd
     Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;
       Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold
     Below her breast was fasten'd with a band
       Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;
     Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd
     About the prettiest ankle in the world.
     Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel
       Flow'd like an Alpine torrent which the sun
     Dyes with his morning light,—and would conceal
       Her person if allow'd at large to run,
     And still they seem resentfully to feel
       The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun
     Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began
     To offer his young pinion as her fan.
     Round her she made an atmosphere of life,
       The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,
     They were so soft and beautiful, and rife
       With all we can imagine of the skies,
     And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife—
       Too pure even for the purest human ties;
     Her overpowering presence made you feel
     It would not be idolatry to kneel.
     Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged
       (It is the country's custom), but in vain;
     For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,
       The glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,
     And in their native beauty stood avenged:
       Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again
     The power of art was turn'd to nothing, for
     They could not look more rosy than before.
     The henna should be deeply dyed to make
       The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;
     She had no need of this, day ne'er will break
       On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:
     The eye might doubt if it were well awake,
       She was so like a vision; I might err,
     But Shakspeare also says, 't is very silly
     'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'
     Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,
       But a white baracan, and so transparent
     The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,
       Like small stars through the milky way apparent;
     His turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,
       An emerald aigrette with Haidee's hair in 't
     Surmounted as its clasp—a glowing crescent,
     Whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.
     And now they were diverted by their suite,
       Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,
     Which made their new establishment complete;
       The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:
     His verses rarely wanted their due feet;
       And for his theme—he seldom sung below it,
     He being paid to satirize or flatter,
     As the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'
     He praised the present, and abused the past,
       Reversing the good custom of old days,
     An Eastern anti-jacobin at last
       He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise—
     For some few years his lot had been o'ercast
       By his seeming independent in his lays,
     But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha
     With truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.
     He was a man who had seen many changes,
       And always changed as true as any needle;
     His polar star being one which rather ranges,
       And not the fix'd—he knew the way to wheedle:
     So vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;
       And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),
     He lied with such a fervour of intention—
     There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.
     But he had genius,—when a turncoat has it,
       The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care
     That without notice few full moons shall pass it;
       Even good men like to make the public stare:—
     But to my subject—let me see—what was it?-
       O!—the third canto—and the pretty pair—
     Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode
     Of living in their insular abode.
     Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less
       In company a very pleasant fellow,
     Had been the favourite of full many a mess
       Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;
     And though his meaning they could rarely guess,
       Yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow
     The glorious meed of popular applause,
     Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.
     But now being lifted into high society,
       And having pick'd up several odds and ends
     Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,
       He deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,
     That, without any danger of a riot, he
       Might for long lying make himself amends;
     And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,
     Agree to a short armistice with truth.
     He had travell'd 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,
       And knew the self-loves of the different nations;
     And having lived with people of all ranks,
       Had something ready upon most occasions—
     Which got him a few presents and some thanks.
       He varied with some skill his adulations;
     To 'do at Rome as Romans do,' a piece
     Of conduct was which he observed in Greece.
     Thus, usually, when he was ask'd to sing,
       He gave the different nations something national;
     'T was all the same to him—'God save the king,'
       Or 'Ca ira,' according to the fashion all:
     His muse made increment of any thing,
       From the high lyric down to the low rational:
     If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder
     Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?
     In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;
       In England a six canto quarto tale;
     In Spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on
       The last war—much the same in Portugal;
     In Germany, the Pegasus he 'd prance on
       Would be old Goethe's (see what says De Stael);
     In Italy he 'd ape the 'Trecentisti;'
     In Greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:
                     THE ISLES OF GREECE.
           The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
             Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
           Where grew the arts of war and peace,
             Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
           Eternal summer gilds them yet,
           But all, except their sun, is set.
           The Scian and the Teian muse,
             The hero's harp, the lover's lute,
           Have found the fame your shores refuse;
             Their place of birth alone is mute
           To sounds which echo further west
           Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.'
           The mountains look on Marathon—
             And Marathon looks on the sea;
           And musing there an hour alone,
             I dream'd that Greece might still be free;
           For standing on the Persians' grave,
           I could not deem myself a slave.
           A king sate on the rocky brow
             Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
           And ships, by thousands, lay below,
             And men in nations;—all were his!
           He counted them at break of day—
           And when the sun set where were they?
           And where are they? and where art thou,
             My country? On thy voiceless shore
           The heroic lay is tuneless now—
             The heroic bosom beats no more!
           And must thy lyre, so long divine,
           Degenerate into hands like mine?
           'T is something, in the dearth of fame,
             Though link'd among a fetter'd race,
           To feel at least a patriot's shame,
             Even as I sing, suffuse my face;
           For what is left the poet here?
           For Greeks a blush—for Greece a tear.
           Must we but weep o'er days more blest?
             Must we but blush?—Our fathers bled.
           Earth! render back from out thy breast
             A remnant of our Spartan dead!
           Of the three hundred grant but three,
           To make a new Thermopylae!
           What, silent still? and silent all?
             Ah! no;—the voices of the dead
           Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
             And answer, 'Let one living head,
           But one arise,—we come, we come!'
           'T is but the living who are dumb.
           In vain—in vain: strike other chords;
             Fill high the cup with Samian wine!
           Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,
             And shed the blood of Scio's vine!
           Hark! rising to the ignoble call—
           How answers each bold Bacchanal!
           You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,
             Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
           Of two such lessons, why forget
             The nobler and the manlier one?
           You have the letters Cadmus gave—
           Think ye he meant them for a slave?
           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             We will not think of themes like these!
           It made Anacreon's song divine:
             He served—but served Polycrates—
           A tyrant; but our masters then
           Were still, at least, our countrymen.
           The tyrant of the Chersonese
             Was freedom's best and bravest friend;
           That tyrant was Miltiades!
             O! that the present hour would lend
           Another despot of the kind!
           Such chains as his were sure to bind.
           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,
           Exists the remnant of a line
             Such as the Doric mothers bore;
           And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,
           The Heracleidan blood might own.
           Trust not for freedom to the Franks—
             They have a king who buys and sells;
           In native swords, and native ranks,
             The only hope of courage dwells;
           But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
           Would break your shield, however broad.
           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             Our virgins dance beneath the shade—
           I see their glorious black eyes shine;
             But gazing on each glowing maid,
           My own the burning tear-drop laves,
           To think such breasts must suckle slaves
           Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,
             Where nothing, save the waves and I,
           May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;
             There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
           A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine—
           Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!
     Thus sung, or would, or could, or should have sung,
       The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;
     If not like Orpheus quite, when Greece was young,
       Yet in these times he might have done much worse:
     His strain display'd some feeling—right or wrong;
       And feeling, in a poet, is the source
     Of others' feeling; but they are such liars,
     And take all colours—like the hands of dyers.
     But words are things, and a small drop of ink,
       Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces
     That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;
       'T is strange, the shortest letter which man uses
     Instead of speech, may form a lasting link
       Of ages; to what straits old Time reduces
     Frail man, when paper—even a rag like this,
     Survives himself, his tomb, and all that 's his.
     And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,
       His station, generation, even his nation,
     Become a thing, or nothing, save to rank
       In chronological commemoration,
     Some dull MS. oblivion long has sank,
       Or graven stone found in a barrack's station
     In digging the foundation of a closet,
     May turn his name up, as a rare deposit.
     And glory long has made the sages smile;
       'T is something, nothing, words, illusion, wind—
     Depending more upon the historian's style
       Than on the name a person leaves behind:
     Troy owes to Homer what whist owes to Hoyle:
       The present century was growing blind
     To the great Marlborough's skill in giving knocks,
     Until his late life by Archdeacon Coxe.
     Milton 's the prince of poets—so we say;
       A little heavy, but no less divine:
     An independent being in his day—
       Learn'd, pious, temperate in love and wine;
     But, his life falling into Johnson's way,
       We 're told this great high priest of all the Nine
     Was whipt at college—a harsh sire—odd spouse,
     For the first Mrs. Milton left his house.
     All these are, certes, entertaining facts,
       Like Shakspeare's stealing deer, Lord Bacon's bribes;
     Like Titus' youth, and Caesar's earliest acts;
       Like Burns (whom Doctor Currie well describes);
     Like Cromwell's pranks;—but although truth exacts
       These amiable descriptions from the scribes,
     As most essential to their hero's story,
     They do not much contribute to his glory.
     All are not moralists, like Southey, when
       He prated to the world of 'Pantisocracy;'
     Or Wordsworth unexcised, unhired, who then
       Season'd his pedlar poems with democracy;
     Or Coleridge, long before his flighty pen
       Let to the Morning Post its aristocracy;
     When he and Southey, following the same path,
     Espoused two partners (milliners of Bath).
     Such names at present cut a convict figure,
       The very Botany Bay in moral geography;
     Their loyal treason, renegado rigour,
       Are good manure for their more bare biography.
     Wordsworth's last quarto, by the way, is bigger
       Than any since the birthday of typography;
     A drowsy frowzy poem, call'd the 'Excursion.'
     Writ in a manner which is my aversion.
     He there builds up a formidable dyke
       Between his own and others' intellect;
     But Wordsworth's poem, and his followers, like
       Joanna Southcote's Shiloh, and her sect,
     Are things which in this century don't strike
       The public mind,—so few are the elect;
     And the new births of both their stale virginities
     Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.
     But let me to my story: I must own,
       If I have any fault, it is digression—
     Leaving my people to proceed alone,
       While I soliloquize beyond expression;
     But these are my addresses from the throne,
       Which put off business to the ensuing session:
     Forgetting each omission is a loss to
     The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.
     I know that what our neighbours call 'longueurs'
       (We 've not so good a word, but have the thing
     In that complete perfection which ensures
       An epic from Bob Southey every spring),
     Form not the true temptation which allures
       The reader; but 't would not be hard to bring
     Some fine examples of the epopee,
     To prove its grand ingredient is ennui.
     We learn from Horace, 'Homer sometimes sleeps;'
       We feel without him, Wordsworth sometimes wakes,—
     To show with what complacency he creeps,
       With his dear 'Waggoners,' around his lakes.
     He wishes for 'a boat' to sail the deeps—
       Of ocean?—No, of air; and then he makes
     Another outcry for 'a little boat,'
     And drivels seas to set it well afloat.
     If he must fain sweep o'er the ethereal plain,
       And Pegasus runs restive in his 'Waggon,'
     Could he not beg the loan of Charles's Wain?
       Or pray Medea for a single dragon?
     Or if, too classic for his vulgar brain,
       He fear'd his neck to venture such a nag on,
     And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,
     Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon?
     'Pedlars,' and 'Boats,' and 'Waggons!' Oh! ye shades
       Of Pope and Dryden, are we come to this?
     That trash of such sort not alone evades
       Contempt, but from the bathos' vast abyss
     Floats scumlike uppermost, and these Jack Cades
       Of sense and song above your graves may hiss—
     The 'little boatman' and his 'Peter Bell'
     Can sneer at him who drew 'Achitophel'!
     T' our tale.—The feast was over, the slaves gone,
       The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;
     The Arab lore and poet's song were done,
       And every sound of revelry expired;
     The lady and her lover, left alone,
       The rosy flood of twilight's sky admired;—
     Ave Maria! o'er the earth and sea,
     That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!
     Ave Maria! blessed be the hour!
       The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft
     Have felt that moment in its fullest power
       Sink o'er the earth so beautiful and soft,
     While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,
       Or the faint dying day-hymn stole aloft,
     And not a breath crept through the rosy air,
     And yet the forest leaves seem'd stirr'd with prayer.
     Ave Maria! 't is the hour of prayer!
       Ave Maria! 't is the hour of love!
     Ave Maria! may our spirits dare
       Look up to thine and to thy Son's above!
     Ave Maria! oh that face so fair!
       Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove—
     What though 't is but a pictured image?—strike—
     That painting is no idol,—'t is too like.
     Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,
       In nameless print—that I have no devotion;
     But set those persons down with me to pray,
       And you shall see who has the properest notion
     Of getting into heaven the shortest way;
       My altars are the mountains and the ocean,
     Earth, air, stars,—all that springs from the great Whole,
     Who hath produced, and will receive the soul.
     Sweet hour of twilight!—in the solitude
       Of the pine forest, and the silent shore
     Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood,
       Rooted where once the Adrian wave flow'd o'er,
     To where the last Caesarean fortress stood,
       Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio's lore
     And Dryden's lay made haunted ground to me,
     How have I loved the twilight hour and thee!
     The shrill cicadas, people of the pine,
       Making their summer lives one ceaseless song,
     Were the sole echoes, save my steed's and mine,
       And vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;
     The spectre huntsman of Onesti's line,
       His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng
     Which learn'd from this example not to fly
     From a true lover,—shadow'd my mind's eye.
     O, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things—
       Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,
     To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,
       The welcome stall to the o'erlabour'd steer;
     Whate'er of peace about our hearthstone clings,
       Whate'er our household gods protect of dear,
     Are gather'd round us by thy look of rest;
     Thou bring'st the child, too, to the mother's breast.
     Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart
       Of those who sail the seas, on the first day
     When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;
       Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way
     As the far bell of vesper makes him start,
       Seeming to weep the dying day's decay;
     Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?
     Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!
     When Nero perish'd by the justest doom
       Which ever the destroyer yet destroy'd,
     Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,
       Of nations freed, and the world overjoy'd,
     Some hands unseen strew'd flowers upon his tomb:
       Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void
     Of feeling for some kindness done, when power
     Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.
     But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,
       Or any such like sovereign buffoons,
     To do with the transactions of my hero,
       More than such madmen's fellow man—the moon's?
     Sure my invention must be down at zero,
       And I grown one of many 'wooden spoons'
     Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please
     To dub the last of honours in degrees).
     I feel this tediousness will never do—
       'T is being too epic, and I must cut down
     (In copying) this long canto into two;
       They 'll never find it out, unless I own
     The fact, excepting some experienced few;
       And then as an improvement 't will be shown:
     I 'll prove that such the opinion of the critic is
     From Aristotle passim.—See poietikes.
CANTO THE FOURTH.
     Nothing so difficult as a beginning
       In poesy, unless perhaps the end;
     For oftentimes when Pegasus seems winning
       The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,
     Like Lucifer when hurl'd from heaven for sinning;
       Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,
     Being pride, which leads the mind to soar too far,
     Till our own weakness shows us what we are.
     But Time, which brings all beings to their level,
       And sharp Adversity, will teach at last
     Man,—and, as we would hope,—perhaps the devil,
       That neither of their intellects are vast:
     While youth's hot wishes in our red veins revel,
       We know not this—the blood flows on too fast;
     But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,
     We ponder deeply on each past emotion.
     As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,
       And wish'd that others held the same opinion;
     They took it up when my days grew more mellow,
       And other minds acknowledged my dominion:
     Now my sere fancy 'falls into the yellow
       Leaf,' and Imagination droops her pinion,
     And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
     Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.
     And if I laugh at any mortal thing,
       'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,
     'T is that our nature cannot always bring
       Itself to apathy, for we must steep
     Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,
       Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:
     Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;
     A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.
     Some have accused me of a strange design
       Against the creed and morals of the land,
     And trace it in this poem every line:
       I don't pretend that I quite understand
     My own meaning when I would be very fine;
       But the fact is that I have nothing plann'd,
     Unless it were to be a moment merry,
     A novel word in my vocabulary.
     To the kind reader of our sober clime
       This way of writing will appear exotic;
     Pulci was sire of the half-serious rhyme,
       Who sang when chivalry was more Quixotic,
     And revell'd in the fancies of the time,
       True knights, chaste dames, huge giants, kings despotic:
     But all these, save the last, being obsolete,
     I chose a modern subject as more meet.
     How I have treated it, I do not know;
       Perhaps no better than they have treated me
     Who have imputed such designs as show
       Not what they saw, but what they wish'd to see:
     But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;
       This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:
     Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,
     And tells me to resume my story here.
     Young Juan and his lady-love were left
       To their own hearts' most sweet society;
     Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft
       With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he
     Sigh'd to behold them of their hours bereft,
       Though foe to love; and yet they could not be
     Meant to grow old, but die in happy spring,
     Before one charm or hope had taken wing.
     Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their
       Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;
     The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,
       But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail
     They were all summer: lightning might assail
       And shiver them to ashes, but to trail
     A long and snake-like life of dull decay
     Was not for them—they had too little day.
     They were alone once more; for them to be
       Thus was another Eden; they were never
     Weary, unless when separate: the tree
       Cut from its forest root of years—the river
     Damm'd from its fountain—the child from the knee
       And breast maternal wean'd at once for ever,—
     Would wither less than these two torn apart;
     Alas! there is no instinct like the heart—
     The heart—which may be broken: happy they!
       Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,
     The precious porcelain of human clay,
       Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold
     The long year link'd with heavy day on day,
       And all which must be borne, and never told;
     While life's strange principle will often lie
     Deepest in those who long the most to die.
     'Whom the gods love die young,' was said of yore,
       And many deaths do they escape by this:
     The death of friends, and that which slays even more—
       The death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,
     Except mere breath; and since the silent shore
       Awaits at last even those who longest miss
     The old archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave
     Which men weep over may be meant to save.
     Haidee and Juan thought not of the dead—
       The heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:
     They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;
       They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:
     Each was the other's mirror, and but read
       Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,
     And knew such brightness was but the reflection
     Of their exchanging glances of affection.
     The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,
       The least glance better understood than words,
     Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;
       A language, too, but like to that of birds,
     Known but to them, at least appearing such
       As but to lovers a true sense affords;
     Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd
     To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard,—
     All these were theirs, for they were children still,
       And children still they should have ever been;
     They were not made in the real world to fill
       A busy character in the dull scene,
     But like two beings born from out a rill,
       A nymph and her beloved, all unseen
     To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,
     And never know the weight of human hours.
     Moons changing had roll'd on, and changeless found
       Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
     As rarely they beheld throughout their round;
       And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,
     For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound
       By the mere senses; and that which destroys
     Most love, possession, unto them appear'd
     A thing which each endearment more endear'd.
     O beautiful! and rare as beautiful
       But theirs was love in which the mind delights
     To lose itself when the old world grows dull,
       And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,
     Intrigues, adventures of the common school,
       Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,
     Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,
     Whose husband only knows her not a wh—re.
     Hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.
       Enough.—The faithful and the fairy pair,
     Who never found a single hour too slow,
       What was it made them thus exempt from care?
     Young innate feelings all have felt below,
       Which perish in the rest, but in them were
     Inherent—what we mortals call romantic,
     And always envy, though we deem it frantic.
     This is in others a factitious state,
       An opium dream of too much youth and reading,
     But was in them their nature or their fate:
       No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,
     For Haidee's knowledge was by no means great,
       And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;
     So that there was no reason for their loves
     More than for those of nightingales or doves.
     They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour
       Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,
     For it had made them what they were: the power
       Of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,
     When happiness had been their only dower,
       And twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;
     Charm'd with each other, all things charm'd that brought
     The past still welcome as the present thought.
     I know not why, but in that hour to-night,
       Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,
     And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,
       Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,
     When one is shook in sound, and one in sight;
       And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,
     And call'd from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,
     While one new tear arose in Haidee's eye.
     That large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate
       And follow far the disappearing sun,
     As if their last day! of a happy date
       With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;
     Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate—
       He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,
     His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
     For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.
     She turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort
       Which makes not others smile; then turn'd aside:
     Whatever feeling shook her, it seem'd short,
       And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;
     When Juan spoke, too—it might be in sport—
       Of this their mutual feeling, she replied—
     'If it should be so,—but—it cannot be—
     Or I at least shall not survive to see.'
     Juan would question further, but she press'd
       His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,
     And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,
       Defying augury with that fond kiss;
     And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:
       Some people prefer wine—'t is not amiss;
     I have tried both; so those who would a part take
     May choose between the headache and the heartache.
     One of the two, according to your choice,
       Woman or wine, you 'll have to undergo;
     Both maladies are taxes on our joys:
       But which to choose, I really hardly know;
     And if I had to give a casting voice,
       For both sides I could many reasons show,
     And then decide, without great wrong to either,
     It were much better to have both than neither.
     Juan and Haidee gazed upon each other
       With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,
     Which mix'd all feelings, friend, child, lover, brother,
       All that the best can mingle and express
     When two pure hearts are pour'd in one another,
       And love too much, and yet can not love less;
     But almost sanctify the sweet excess
     By the immortal wish and power to bless.
     Mix'd in each other's arms, and heart in heart,
       Why did they not then die?—they had lived too long
     Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;
       Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;
     The world was not for them, nor the world's art
       For beings passionate as Sappho's song;
     Love was born with them, in them, so intense,
     It was their very spirit—not a sense.
     They should have lived together deep in woods,
       Unseen as sings the nightingale; they were
     Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes
       Call'd social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:
     How lonely every freeborn creature broods!
       The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;
     The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow
     Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.
     Now pillow'd cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,
       Haidee and Juan their siesta took,
     A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,
       For ever and anon a something shook
     Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;
       And Haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook
     A wordless music, and her face so fair
     Stirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.
     Or as the stirring of a deep dear stream
       Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind
     Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,
       The mystical usurper of the mind—
     O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem
       Good to the soul which we no more can bind;
     Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)
     Senseless to feel, and with seal'd eyes to see.
     She dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,
       Chain'd to a rock; she knew not how, but stir
     She could not from the spot, and the loud roar
       Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;
     And o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,
       Until she sobb'd for breath, and soon they were
     Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high—
     Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.
     Anon—she was released, and then she stray'd
       O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,
     And stumbled almost every step she made;
       And something roll'd before her in a sheet,
     Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:
       'T was white and indistinct, nor stopp'd to meet
     Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,
     And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.
     The dream changed:—in a cave she stood, its walls
       Were hung with marble icicles, the work
     Of ages on its water-fretted halls,
       Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;
     Her hair was dripping, and the very balls
       Of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk
     The sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,
     Which froze to marble as it fell,—she thought.
     And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,
       Pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,
     Which she essay'd in vain to clear (how sweet
       Were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!),
     Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat
       Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low
     Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,
     And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.
     And gazing on the dead, she thought his face
       Faded, or alter'd into something new—
     Like to her father's features, till each trace—
       More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew—
     With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;
       And starting, she awoke, and what to view?
     O! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?
     'T is—'t is her father's—fix'd upon the pair!
     Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,
       With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see
     Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell
       The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be
     Perchance the death of one she loved too well:
       Dear as her father had been to Haidee,
     It was a moment of that awful kind—
     I have seen such—but must not call to mind.
     Up Juan sprung to Haidee's bitter shriek,
       And caught her falling, and from off the wall
     Snatch'd down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak
       Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:
     Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,
       Smiled scornfully, and said, 'Within my call,
     A thousand scimitars await the word;
     Put up, young man, put up your silly sword.'
     And Haidee clung around him; 'Juan, 't is—
       'T is Lambro—'t is my father! Kneel with me—
     He will forgive us—yes—it must be—yes.
       O! dearest father, in this agony
     Of pleasure and of pain—even while I kiss
       Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be
     That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?
     Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy.'
     High and inscrutable the old man stood,
       Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye—
     Not always signs with him of calmest mood:
       He look'd upon her, but gave no reply;
     Then turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood
       Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;
     In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring
     On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.
     'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:
       Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'
     The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,
       And drawing from his belt a pistol, he
     Replied, 'Your blood be then on your own head.'
       Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see
     'T was fresh—for he had lately used the lock—
     And next proceeded quietly to cock.
     It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,
       That cocking of a pistol, when you know
     A moment more will bring the sight to bear
       Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;
     A gentlemanly distance, not too near,
       If you have got a former friend for foe;
     But after being fired at once or twice,
     The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.
     Lambro presented, and one instant more
       Had stopp'd this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,
     When Haidee threw herself her boy before;
       Stern as her sire: 'On me,' she cried, 'let death
     Descend—the fault is mine; this fatal shore
       He found—but sought not. I have pledged my faith;
     I love him—I will die with him: I knew
     Your nature's firmness—know your daughter's too.'
     A minute past, and she had been all tears,
       And tenderness, and infancy; but now
     She stood as one who champion'd human fears—
       Pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo'd the blow;
     And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,
       She drew up to her height, as if to show
     A fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd
     Her father's face—but never stopp'd his hand.
     He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange
       How like they look'd! the expression was the same;
     Serenely savage, with a little change
       In the large dark eye's mutual-darted flame;
     For she, too, was as one who could avenge,
       If cause should be—a lioness, though tame.
     Her father's blood before her father's face
     Boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.
     I said they were alike, their features and
       Their stature, differing but in sex and years;
     Even to the delicacy of their hand
       There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;
     And now to see them, thus divided, stand
       In fix'd ferocity, when joyous tears
     And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,
     Show what the passions are in their full growth.
     The father paused a moment, then withdrew
       His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,
     And looking on her, as to look her through,
       'Not I,' he said, 'have sought this stranger's ill;
     Not I have made this desolation: few
       Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;
     But I must do my duty—how thou hast
     Done thine, the present vouches for the past.
     'Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,
       His own shall roll before you like a ball!'
     He raised his whistle, as the word he said,
       And blew; another answer'd to the call,
     And rushing in disorderly, though led,
       And arm'd from boot to turban, one and all,
     Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;
     He gave the word,—'Arrest or slay the Frank.'
     Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew
       His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,
     'Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;
       In vain she struggled in her father's grasp—
     His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew
       Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,
     The file of pirates; save the foremost, who
     Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.
     The second had his cheek laid open; but
       The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took
     The blows upon his cutlass, and then put
       His own well in; so well, ere you could look,
     His man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,
       With the blood running like a little brook
     From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red—
     One on the arm, the other on the head.
     And then they bound him where he fell, and bore
       Juan from the apartment: with a sign
     Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,
       Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.
     They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar
       Until they reach'd some galliots, placed in line;
     On board of one of these, and under hatches,
     They stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.
     The world is full of strange vicissitudes,
       And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:
     A gentleman so rich in the world's goods,
       Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,
     Just at the very time when he least broods
       On such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,
     Wounded and chain'd, so that he cannot move,
     And all because a lady fell in love.
     Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,
       Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!
     Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;
       For if my pure libations exceed three,
     I feel my heart become so sympathetic,
       That I must have recourse to black Bohea:
     'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,
     For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,
     Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!
       Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!
     Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,
       And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?
     I would take refuge in weak punch, but rack
       (In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill
     My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,
     Wakes me next morning with its synonym.
     I leave Don Juan for the present, safe—
       Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;
     Yet could his corporal pangs amount to half
       Of those with which his Haidee's bosom bounded?
     She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,
       And then give way, subdued because surrounded;
     Her mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,
     Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.
     There the large olive rains its amber store
       In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,
     Gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;
       But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,
     And midnight listens to the lion's roar,
       And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,
     Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;
     And as the soil is, so the heart of man.
     Afric is all the sun's, and as her earth
       Her human day is kindled; full of power
     For good or evil, burning from its birth,
       The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,
     And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:
       Beauty and love were Haidee's mother's dower;
     But her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,
     Though sleeping like a lion near a source.
     Her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,
       Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,
     Till slowly charged with thunder they display
       Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,
     Had held till now her soft and milky way;
       But overwrought with passion and despair,
     The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,
     Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.
     The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,
       And he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;
     His blood was running on the very floor
       Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;
     Thus much she view'd an instant and no more,—
       Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;
     On her sire's arm, which until now scarce held
     Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.
     A vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes
       Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;
     And her head droop'd as when the lily lies
       O'ercharged with rain: her summon'd handmaids bore
     Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;
       Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,
     But she defied all means they could employ,
     Like one life could not hold, nor death destroy.
     Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill—
       With nothing livid, still her lips were red;
     She had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;
       No hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;
     Corruption came not in each mind to kill
       All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred
     New thoughts of life, for it seem'd full of soul—
     She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.
     The ruling passion, such as marble shows
       When exquisitely chisell'd, still lay there,
     But fix'd as marble's unchanged aspect throws
       O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;
     O'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,
       And ever-dying Gladiator's air,
     Their energy like life forms all their fame,
     Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.
     She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,
       Rather the dead, for life seem'd something new,
     A strange sensation which she must partake
       Perforce, since whatsoever met her view
     Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache
       Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true
     Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,
     For, for a while, the furies made a pause.
     She look'd on many a face with vacant eye,
       On many a token without knowing what;
     She saw them watch her without asking why,
       And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;
     Not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh
       Relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat
     Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave
     No sign, save breath, of having left the grave.
     Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;
       Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;
     She recognized no being, and no spot,
       However dear or cherish'd in their day;
     They changed from room to room—but all forgot—
       Gentle, but without memory she lay;
     At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning
     Back to old thoughts, wax'd full of fearful meaning.
     And then a slave bethought her of a harp;
       The harper came, and tuned his instrument;
     At the first notes, irregular and sharp,
       On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,
     Then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp
       Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;
     And he begun a long low island song
     Of ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong.
     Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall
       In time to his old tune; he changed the theme,
     And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all
       Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream
     Of what she was, and is, if ye could call
       To be so being; in a gushing stream
     The tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,
     Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.
     Short solace, vain relief!—thought came too quick,
       And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose
     As one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,
       And flew at all she met, as on her foes;
     But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,
       Although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;—
     Hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,
     Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.
     Yet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;
       Nothing could make her meet her father's face,
     Though on all other things with looks intense
       She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;
     Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence
       Avail'd for either; neither change of place,
     Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her
     Senses to sleep—the power seem'd gone for ever.
     Twelve days and nights she wither'd thus; at last,
       Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show
     A parting pang, the spirit from her past:
       And they who watch'd her nearest could not know
     The very instant, till the change that cast
       Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,
     Glazed o'er her eyes—the beautiful, the black—
     O! to possess such lustre—and then lack!
     She died, but not alone; she held within
       A second principle of life, which might
     Have dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;
       But closed its little being without light,
     And went down to the grave unborn, wherein
       Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;
     In vain the dews of Heaven descend above
     The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love.
     Thus lived—thus died she; never more on her
       Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made
     Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,
       Which colder hearts endure till they are laid
     By age in earth: her days and pleasures were
       Brief, but delightful—such as had not staid
     Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well
     By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.
     That isle is now all desolate and bare,
       Its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;
     None but her own and father's grave is there,
       And nothing outward tells of human clay;
     Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,
       No stone is there to show, no tongue to say
     What was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,
     Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades.
     But many a Greek maid in a loving song
       Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander
     With her sire's story makes the night less long;
       Valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:
     If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong—
       A heavy price must all pay who thus err,
     In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,
     For soon or late Love is his own avenger.
     But let me change this theme which grows too sad,
       And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;
     I don't much like describing people mad,
       For fear of seeming rather touch'd myself—
     Besides, I 've no more on this head to add;
       And as my Muse is a capricious elf,
     We 'll put about, and try another tack
     With Juan, left half-kill'd some stanzas back.
     Wounded and fetter'd, 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,'
       Some days and nights elapsed before that he
     Could altogether call the past to mind;
       And when he did, he found himself at sea,
     Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;
       The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee—
     Another time he might have liked to see 'em,
     But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.
     There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is
       (Flank'd by the Hellespont and by the sea)
     Entomb'd the bravest of the brave, Achilles;
       They say so (Bryant says the contrary):
     And further downward, tall and towering still, is
       The tumulus—of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be
     Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus—
     All heroes, who if living still would slay us.
     High barrows, without marble or a name,
       A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,
     And Ida in the distance, still the same,
       And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;
     The situation seems still form'd for fame—
       A hundred thousand men might fight again
     With case; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,
     The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;
     Troops of untended horses; here and there
       Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;
     Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare
       A moment at the European youth
     Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;
       A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,
     Extremely taken with his own religion,
     Are what I found there—but the devil a Phrygian.
     Don Juan, here permitted to emerge
       From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;
     Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,
       O'ershadow'd there by many a hero's grave;
     Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge
       A few brief questions; and the answers gave
     No very satisfactory information
     About his past or present situation.
     He saw some fellow captives, who appear'd
       To be Italians, as they were in fact;
     From them, at least, their destiny he heard,
       Which was an odd one; a troop going to act
     In Sicily (all singers, duly rear'd
       In their vocation) had not been attack'd
     In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,
     But sold by the impresario at no high rate.
     By one of these, the buffo of the party,
       Juan was told about their curious case;
     For although destined to the Turkish mart, he
       Still kept his spirits up—at least his face;
     The little fellow really look'd quite hearty,
       And bore him with some gaiety and grace,
     Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,
     Than did the prima donna and the tenor.
     In a few words he told their hapless story,
       Saying, 'Our Machiavellian impresario,
     Making a signal off some promontory,
       Hail'd a strange brig—Corpo di Caio Mario!
     We were transferr'd on board her in a hurry,
       Without a Single scudo of salario;
     But if the Sultan has a taste for song,
     We will revive our fortunes before long.
     'The prima donna, though a little old,
       And haggard with a dissipated life,
     And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,
       Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,
     With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;
       Last carnival she made a deal of strife
     By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna
     From an old Roman princess at Bologna.
     'And then there are the dancers; there 's the Nini,
       With more than one profession, gains by all;
     Then there 's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,
       She, too, was fortunate last carnival,
     And made at least five hundred good zecchini,
       But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;
     And then there 's the Grotesca—such a dancer!
     Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.
     'As for the figuranti, they are like
       The rest of all that tribe; with here and there
     A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,
       The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;
     There 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,
       Yet has a sentimental kind of air
     Which might go far, but she don't dance with vigour;
     The more 's the pity, with her face and figure.
     'As for the men, they are a middling set;
       The musico is but a crack'd old basin,
     But being qualified in one way yet,
       May the seraglio do to set his face in,
     And as a servant some preferment get;
       His singing I no further trust can place in:
     From all the Pope makes yearly 't would perplex
     To find three perfect pipes of the third sex.
     'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,
       And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;
     In fact, he had no singing education,
       An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;
     But being the prima donna's near relation,
       Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,
     They hired him, though to hear him you 'd believe
     An ass was practising recitative.
     ''T would not become myself to dwell upon
       My own merits, and though young—I see, Sir—you
     Have got a travell'd air, which speaks you one
       To whom the opera is by no means new:
     You 've heard of Raucocanti?—I 'm the man;
       The time may come when you may hear me too;
     You was not last year at the fair of Lugo,
     But next, when I 'm engaged to sing there—do go.
     'Our baritone I almost had forgot,
       A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;
     With graceful action, science not a jot,
       A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,
     He always is complaining of his lot,
       Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;
     In lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,
     Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'
     Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital
       Was interrupted by the pirate crew,
     Who came at stated moments to invite all
       The captives back to their sad berths; each threw
     A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all
       From the blue skies derived a double blue,
     Dancing all free and happy in the sun),
     And then went down the hatchway one by one.
     They heard next day—that in the Dardanelles,
       Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,
     The most imperative of sovereign spells,
       Which every body does without who can,
     More to secure them in their naval cells,
       Lady to lady, well as man to man,
     Were to be chain'd and lotted out per couple,
     For the slave market of Constantinople.
     It seems when this allotment was made out,
       There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,
     Who (after some discussion and some doubt,
       If the soprano might be deem'd to be male,
     They placed him o'er the women as a scout)
       Were link'd together, and it happen'd the male
     Was Juan,—who, an awkward thing at his age,
     Pair'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage.
     With Raucocanti lucklessly was chain'd
       The tenor; these two hated with a hate
     Found only on the stage, and each more pain'd
       With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;
     Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain'd,
       Instead of bearing up without debate,
     That each pull'd different ways with many an oath,
     'Arcades ambo,' id est—blackguards both.
     Juan's companion was a Romagnole,
       But bred within the March of old Ancona,
     With eyes that look'd into the very soul
       (And other chief points of a 'bella donna'),
     Bright—and as black and burning as a coal;
       And through her dear brunette complexion shone
     Great wish to please—a most attractive dower,
     Especially when added to the power.
     But all that power was wasted upon him,
       For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;
     Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;
       And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand
     Touch'd his, nor that—nor any handsome limb
       (And she had some not easy to withstand)
     Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;
     Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.
     No matter; we should ne'er too much enquire,
       But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,
     And firmer faith no ladye—love desire;
       We will omit the proofs, save one or two:
     'T is said no one in hand 'can hold a fire
       By thought of frosty Caucasus;' but few,
     I really think; yet Juan's then ordeal
     Was more triumphant, and not much less real.
     Here I might enter on a chaste description,
       Having withstood temptation in my youth,
     But hear that several people take exception
       At the first two books having too much truth;
     Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,
       Because the publisher declares, in sooth,
     Through needles' eyes it easier for the camel is
     To pass, than those two cantos into families.
     'T is all the same to me; I 'm fond of yielding,
       And therefore leave them to the purer page
     Of Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,
       Who say strange things for so correct an age;
     I once had great alacrity in wielding
       My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,
     And recollect the time when all this cant
     Would have provoked remarks which now it shan't.
     As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;
       But at this hour I wish to part in peace,
     Leaving such to the literary rabble:
       Whether my verse's fame be doom'd to cease
     While the right hand which wrote it still is able,
       Or of some centuries to take a lease,
     The grass upon my grave will grow as long,
     And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.
     Of poets who come down to us through distance
       Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,
     Life seems the smallest portion of existence;
       Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,
     'T is as a snowball which derives assistance
       From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,
     Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow;
     But, after all, 't is nothing but cold snow.
     And so great names are nothing more than nominal,
       And love of glory 's but an airy lust,
     Too often in its fury overcoming all
       Who would as 't were identify their dust
     From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,
       Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'-
     Save change: I 've stood upon Achilles' tomb,
     And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.
     The very generations of the dead
       Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,
     Until the memory of an age is fled,
       And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:
     Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?
       Save a few glean'd from the sepulchral gloom
     Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,
     And lose their own in universal death.
     I canter by the spot each afternoon
       Where perish'd in his fame the hero-boy,
     Who lived too long for men, but died too soon
       For human vanity, the young De Foix!
     A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,
       But which neglect is hastening to destroy,
     Records Ravenna's carnage on its face,
     While weeds and ordure rankle round the base.
     I pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:
       A little cupola, more neat than solemn,
     Protects his dust, but reverence here is paid
       To the bard's tomb, and not the warrior's column.
     The time must come, when both alike decay'd,
       The chieftain's trophy, and the poet's volume,
     Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,
     Before Pelides' death, or Homer's birth.
     With human blood that column was cemented,
       With human filth that column is defiled,
     As if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented
       To show his loathing of the spot he soil'd:
     Thus is the trophy used, and thus lamented
       Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild
     Instinct of gore and glory earth has known
     Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.
     Yet there will still be bards: though fame is smoke,
       Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;
     And the unquiet feelings, which first woke
       Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;
     As on the beach the waves at last are broke,
       Thus to their extreme verge the passions brought
     Dash into poetry, which is but passion,
     Or at least was so ere it grew a fashion.
     If in the course of such a life as was
       At once adventurous and contemplative,
     Men, who partake all passions as they pass,
       Acquire the deep and bitter power to give
     Their images again as in a glass,
       And in such colours that they seem to live;
     You may do right forbidding them to show 'em,
     But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.
     O! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!
       Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!
     Who advertise new poems by your looks,
       Your 'imprimatur' will ye not annex?
     What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,
       Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?
     Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,
     Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea!
     What! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?
       A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?
     To bear the compliments of many a bore,
       And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;
     Why then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore
       (Because the world won't read him, always snarling),
     That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,
     Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.
     O! 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,'
       As some one somewhere sings about the sky,
     And I, ye learned ladies, say of you;
       They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,
     I have examined few pair of that hue);
       Blue as the garters which serenely lie
     Round the Patrician left-legs, which adorn
     The festal midnight, and the levee morn.
     Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures—
       But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,
     You read my stanzas, and I read your features:
       And—but no matter, all those things are over;
     Still I have no dislike to learned natures,
       For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;
     I knew one woman of that purple school,
     The loveliest, chastest, best, but—quite a fool.
     Humboldt, 'the first of travellers,' but not
       The last, if late accounts be accurate,
     Invented, by some name I have forgot,
       As well as the sublime discovery's date,
     An airy instrument, with which he sought
       To ascertain the atmospheric state,
     By measuring 'the intensity of blue:'
     O, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!
     But to the narrative:—The vessel bound
       With slaves to sell off in the capital,
     After the usual process, might be found
       At anchor under the seraglio wall;
     Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,
       Were landed in the market, one and all,
     And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,
     Bought up for different purposes and passions.
     Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
       For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
     Warranted virgin; beauty's brightest colours
       Had deck'd her out in all the hues of heaven:
     Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
       Who bade on till the hundreds reach'd eleven;
     But when the offer went beyond, they knew
     'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
     Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price
       Which the West Indian market scarce would bring;
     Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice
       What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing
     Need not seem very wonderful, for vice
       Is always much more splendid than a king:
     The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,
     Are saving—vice spares nothing for a rarity.
     But for the destiny of this young troop,
       How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,
     How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,
       And others rose to the command of crews
     As renegadoes; while in hapless group,
       Hoping no very old vizier might choose,
     The females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,
     To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:
     All this must be reserved for further song;
       Also our hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant
     (Because this Canto has become too long),
       Must be postponed discreetly for the present;
     I 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,
       But could not for the muse of me put less in 't:
     And now delay the progress of Don Juan,
     Till what is call'd in Ossian the fifth Juan.
Canto 5
CANTO THE FIFTH.
     When amatory poets sing their loves
       In liquid lines mellifluously bland,
     And pair their rhymes as Venus yokes her doves,
       They little think what mischief is in hand;
     The greater their success the worse it proves,
       As Ovid's verse may give to understand;
     Even Petrarch's self, if judged with due severity,
     Is the Platonic pimp of all posterity.
     I therefore do denounce all amorous writing,
       Except in such a way as not to attract;
     Plain—simple—short, and by no means inviting,
       But with a moral to each error tack'd,
     Form'd rather for instructing than delighting,
       And with all passions in their turn attack'd;
     Now, if my Pegasus should not be shod ill,
     This poem will become a moral model.
     The European with the Asian shore
       Sprinkled with palaces; the ocean stream
     Here and there studded with a seventy-four;
       Sophia's cupola with golden gleam;
     The cypress groves; Olympus high and hoar;
       The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,
     Far less describe, present the very view
     Which charm'd the charming Mary Montagu.
     I have a passion for the name of 'Mary,'
       For once it was a magic sound to me;
     And still it half calls up the realms of fairy,
       Where I beheld what never was to be;
     All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,
       A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:
     But I grow sad—and let a tale grow cold,
     Which must not be pathetically told.
     The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave
       Broke foaming o'er the blue Symplegades;
     'T is a grand sight from off 'the Giant's Grave
       To watch the progress of those rolling seas
     Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave
       Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease;
     There 's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,
     Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine.
     'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,
       When nights are equal, but not so the days;
     The Parcae then cut short the further spinning
       Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise
     The waters, and repentance for past sinning
       In all, who o'er the great deep take their ways:
     They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don't;
     Because if drown'd, they can't—if spared, they won't.
     A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,
       And age, and sex, were in the market ranged;
     Each bevy with the merchant in his station:
       Poor creatures! their good looks were sadly changed.
     All save the blacks seem'd jaded with vexation,
       From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;
     The negroes more philosophy display'd,—
     Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flay'd.
     Juan was juvenile, and thus was full,
       As most at his age are, of hope and health;
     Yet I must own he looked a little dull,
       And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;
     Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull
       His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,
     A mistress, and such comfortable quarters,
     To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,
     Were things to shake a stoic; ne'ertheless,
       Upon the whole his carriage was serene:
     His figure, and the splendour of his dress,
       Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,
     Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess
       He was above the vulgar by his mien;
     And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;
     And then—they calculated on his ransom.
     Like a backgammon board the place was dotted
       With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,
     Though rather more irregularly spotted:
       Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.
     It chanced amongst the other people lotted,
       A man of thirty rather stout and hale,
     With resolution in his dark grey eye,
     Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.
     He had an English look; that is, was square
       In make, of a complexion white and ruddy,
     Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,
       And, it might be from thought or toil or study,
     An open brow a little mark'd with care:
       One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;
     And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater
     Could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator.
     But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,
       Of a high spirit evidently, though
     At present weigh'd down by a doom which had
       O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show
     A kind of blunt compassion for the sad
       Lot of so young a partner in the woe,
     Which for himself he seem'd to deem no worse
     Than any other scrape, a thing of course.
     'My boy!' said he, 'amidst this motley crew
       Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,
     All ragamuffins differing but in hue,
       With whom it is our luck to cast our lot,
     The only gentlemen seem I and you;
       So let us be acquainted, as we ought:
     If I could yield you any consolation,
     'T would give me pleasure.—Pray, what is your nation?'
     When Juan answer'd—'Spanish!' he replied,
       'I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek;
     Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:
       Fortune has play'd you here a pretty freak,
     But that 's her way with all men, till they 're tried;
       But never mind,—she 'll turn, perhaps, next week;
     She has served me also much the same as you,
     Except that I have found it nothing new.'
     'Pray, sir,' said Juan, 'if I may presume,
       What brought you here?'—'Oh! nothing very rare—
     Six Tartars and a drag-chain.'—'To this doom
       But what conducted, if the question's fair,
     Is that which I would learn.'—'I served for some
       Months with the Russian army here and there,
     And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,
     A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin.'
     'Have you no friends?'—'I had—but, by God's blessing,
       Have not been troubled with them lately. Now
     I have answer'd all your questions without pressing,
       And you an equal courtesy should show.'
     'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing,
       And long besides.'—'Oh! if 't is really so,
     You 're right on both accounts to hold your tongue;
     A sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long.
     'But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,
       Although a female moderately fickle,
     Will hardly leave you (as she 's not your wife)
       For any length of days in such a pickle.
     To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife
       As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:
     Men are the sport of circumstances, when
     The circumstances seem the sport of men.'
     ''T is not,' said Juan, 'for my present doom
       I mourn, but for the past;—I loved a maid:'-
     He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;
       A single tear upon his eyelash staid
     A moment, and then dropp'd; 'but to resume,
       'T is not my present lot, as I have said,
     Which I deplore so much; for I have borne
     Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,
     'On the rough deep. But this last blow-' and here
       He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.
     'Ay,' quoth his friend, 'I thought it would appear
       That there had been a lady in the case;
     And these are things which ask a tender tear,
       Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:
     I cried upon my first wife's dying day,
     And also when my second ran away:
     'My third-'—'Your third!' quoth Juan, turning round;
       'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?'
     'No—only two at present above ground:
       Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see
     One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'
       'Well, then, your third,' said Juan; 'what did she?
     She did not run away, too,—did she, sir?'
     'No, faith.'—'What then?'—'I ran away from her.'
     'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'
       Replied the other, 'what can a man do?
     There still are many rainbows in your sky,
       But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new,
     Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;
       But time strips our illusions of their hue,
     And one by one in turn, some grand mistake
     Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.
     ''T is true, it gets another bright and fresh,
       Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,
     This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,
       Or sometimes only wear a week or two;—
     Love 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;
       Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue
     The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,
     Where still we flutter on for pence or praise.'
     'All this is very fine, and may be true,'
       Said Juan; 'but I really don't see how
     It betters present times with me or you.'
       'No?' quoth the other; 'yet you will allow
     By setting things in their right point of view,
       Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now,
     We know what slavery is, and our disasters
     May teach us better to behave when masters.'
     'Would we were masters now, if but to try
       Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,'
     Said Juan,—swallowing a heart-burning sigh:
       'Heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here!'
     'Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,'
       Rejoin'd the other, when our bad luck mends here;
     Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)
     'But after all, what is our present state?
       'T is bad, and may be better—all men's lot:
     Most men are slaves, none more so than the great,
       To their own whims and passions, and what not;
     Society itself, which should create
       Kindness, destroys what little we had got:
     To feel for none is the true social art
     Of the world's stoics—men without a heart.'
     Just now a black old neutral personage
       Of the third sex stept up, and peering over
     The captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age,
       And capabilities, as to discover
     If they were fitted for the purposed cage:
       No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,
     Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,
     Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,
     As is a slave by his intended bidder.
       'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;
     And all are to be sold, if you consider
       Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features
     Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,
       Some by a place—as tend their years or natures;
     The most by ready cash—but all have prices,
     From crowns to kicks, according to their vices.
     The eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,
       Turn'd to the merchant, and begun to bid
     First but for one, and after for the pair;
       They haggled, wrangled, swore, too—so they did!
     As though they were in a mere Christian fair
       Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;
     So that their bargain sounded like a battle
     For this superior yoke of human cattle.
     At last they settled into simple grumbling,
       And pulling out reluctant purses, and
     Turning each piece of silver o'er, and tumbling
       Some down, and weighing others in their hand,
     And by mistake sequins with paras jumbling,
       Until the sum was accurately scann'd,
     And then the merchant giving change, and signing
     Receipts in full, began to think of dining.
     I wonder if his appetite was good?
       Or, if it were, if also his digestion?
     Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,
       And conscience ask a curious sort of question,
     About the right divine how far we should
       Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has opprest one,
     I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour
     Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.
     Voltaire says 'No:' he tells you that Candide
       Found life most tolerable after meals;
     He 's wrong—unless man were a pig, indeed,
       Repletion rather adds to what he feels,
     Unless he 's drunk, and then no doubt he 's freed
       From his own brain's oppression while it reels.
     Of food I think with Philip's son, or rather
     Ammon's (ill pleased with one world and one father);
     I think with Alexander, that the act
       Of eating, with another act or two,
     Makes us feel our mortality in fact
       Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,
     And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,
       Can give us either pain or pleasure, who
     Would pique himself on intellects, whose use
     Depends so much upon the gastric juice?
     The other evening ('t was on Friday last)—
       This is a fact and no poetic fable—
     Just as my great coat was about me cast,
       My hat and gloves still lying on the table,
     I heard a shot—'t was eight o'clock scarce past—
       And, running out as fast as I was able,
     I found the military commandant
     Stretch'd in the street, and able scarce to pant.
     Poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,
       They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there
     To perish on the pavement: so I had
       Him borne into the house and up the stair,
     And stripp'd and look'd to—But why should I ad
       More circumstances? vain was every care;
     The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel
     Kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.
     I gazed upon him, for I knew him well;
       And though I have seen many corpses, never
     Saw one, whom such an accident befell,
       So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,
     He seem'd to sleep,—for you could scarcely tell
       (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river
     Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:
     So as I gazed on him, I thought or said—
     'Can this be death? then what is life or death?
       Speak!' but he spoke not: 'Wake!' but still he slept:—
     'But yesterday and who had mightier breath?
       A thousand warriors by his word were kept
     In awe: he said, as the centurion saith,
       "Go," and he goeth; "come," and forth he stepp'd.
     The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb—
     And now nought left him but the muffled drum.'
     And they who waited once and worshipp'd—they
       With their rough faces throng'd about the bed
     To gaze once more on the commanding clay
       Which for the last, though not the first, time bled:
     And such an end! that he who many a day
       Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,—
     The foremost in the charge or in the sally,
     Should now be butcher'd in a civic alley.
     The scars of his old wounds were near his new,
       Those honourable scars which brought him fame;
     And horrid was the contrast to the view—
       But let me quit the theme; as such things claim
     Perhaps even more attention than is due
       From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)
     To try if I could wrench aught out of death
     Which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;
     But it was all a mystery. Here we are,
       And there we go:—but where? five bits of lead,
     Or three, or two, or one, send very far!
       And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?
     Can every element our elements mar?
       And air—earth—water—fire live—and we dead?
     We whose minds comprehend all things? No more;
     But let us to the story as before.
     The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance
       Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,
     Embark'd himself and them, and off they went thence
       As fast as oars could pull and water float;
     They look'd like persons being led to sentence,
       Wondering what next, till the caique was brought
     Up in a little creek below a wall
     O'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall.
     Here their conductor tapping at the wicket
       Of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and
     He led them onward, first through a low thicket
       Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:
     They almost lost their way, and had to pick it—
       For night was dosing ere they came to land.
     The eunuch made a sign to those on board,
     Who row'd off, leaving them without a word.
     As they were plodding on their winding way
       Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth
     (Of which I might have a good deal to say,
       There being no such profusion in the North
     Of oriental plants, 'et cetera,'
       But that of late your scribblers think it worth
     Their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works
     Because one poet travell'd 'mongst the Turks)—
     As they were threading on their way, there came
       Into Don Juan's head a thought, which he
     Whisper'd to his companion:—'t was the same
       Which might have then occurr'd to you or me.
     'Methinks,' said he, 'it would be no great shame
       If we should strike a stroke to set us free;
     Let 's knock that old black fellow on the head,
     And march away—'t were easier done than said.'
     'Yes,' said the other, 'and when done, what then?
       How get out? how the devil got we in?
     And when we once were fairly out, and when
       From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,
     To-morrow 'd see us in some other den,
       And worse off than we hitherto have been;
     Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,
     Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.
     'We must be near some place of man's abode;—
       For the old negro's confidence in creeping,
     With his two captives, by so queer a road,
       Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;
     A single cry would bring them all abroad:
       'T is therefore better looking before leaping—
     And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,
     By Jove, a noble palace!—lighted too.'
     It was indeed a wide extensive building
       Which open'd on their view, and o'er the front
     There seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding
       And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,—
     A gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in
       The arts of which these lands were once the font:
     Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen
     New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.
     And nearer as they came, a genial savour
       Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,
     Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,
       Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,
     And put himself upon his good behaviour:
       His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,
     Said, 'In Heaven's name let's get some supper now,
     And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'
     Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,
       Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;
     The last of these was never much the fashion,
       For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.
     Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,
       But more or less continue still to tease on,
     With arguments according to their 'forte;'
     But no one dreams of ever being short.-
     But I digress: of all appeals,—although
       I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,
     Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,—no
       Method 's more sure at moments to take hold
     Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow
       More tender, as we every day behold,
     Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,
     The tocsin of the soul—the dinner-bell.
     Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;
       And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard
     No Christian knoll to table, saw no line
       Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,
     Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,
       And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,
     And gazed around them to the left and right
     With the prophetic eye of appetite.
     And giving up all notions of resistance,
       They follow'd close behind their sable guide,
     Who little thought that his own crack'd existence
       Was on the point of being set aside:
     He motion'd them to stop at some small distance,
       And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,
     And a magnificent large hall display'd
     The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.
     I won't describe; description is my forte,
       But every fool describes in these bright days
     His wondrous journey to some foreign court,
       And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise—
     Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;
       While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,
     Resigns herself with exemplary patience
     To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.
     Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted
       Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;
     Others in monosyllable talk chatted,
       And some seem'd much in love with their own dress.
     And divers smoked superb pipes decorated
       With amber mouths of greater price or less;
     And several strutted, others slept, and some
     Prepared for supper with a glass of rum.
     As the black eunuch enter'd with his brace
       Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes
     A moment without slackening from their pace;
       But those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise:
     One or two stared the captives in the face,
       Just as one views a horse to guess his price;
     Some nodded to the negro from their station,
     But no one troubled him with conversation.
     He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,
       On through a farther range of goodly rooms,
     Splendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping,
       A marble fountain echoes through the glooms
     Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping
       Some female head most curiously presumes
     To thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,
     As wondering what the devil a noise that is.
     Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls
       Gave light enough to hint their farther way,
     But not enough to show the imperial halls,
       In all the flashing of their full array;
     Perhaps there 's nothing—I 'll not say appals,
       But saddens more by night as well as day,
     Than an enormous room without a soul
     To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.
     Two or three seem so little, one seems nothing:
       In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,
     There solitude, we know, has her full growth in
       The spots which were her realms for evermore;
     But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in
       More modern buildings and those built of yore,
     A kind of death comes o'er us all alone,
     Seeing what 's meant for many with but one.
     A neat, snug study on a winter's night,
       A book, friend, single lady, or a glass
     Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,
       Are things which make an English evening pass;
     Though certes by no means so grand a sight
       As is a theatre lit up by gas.
     I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,
     And that 's the reason I 'm so melancholy.
     Alas! man makes that great which makes him little:
       I grant you in a church 't is very well:
     What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,
       But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell
     Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill—
       And huge tombs worse—mankind, since Adam fell:
     Methinks the story of the tower of Babel
     Might teach them this much better than I 'm able.
     Babel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then
       A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,
     Where Nabuchadonosor, king of men,
       Reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing,
     And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,
       The people's awe and admiration raising;
     'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,
     And the calumniated queen Semiramis.
     That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse
       Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)
     Of an improper friendship for her horse
       (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):
     This monstrous tale had probably its source
       (For such exaggerations here and there I see)
     In writing 'Courser' by mistake for 'Courier:'
     I wish the case could come before a jury here.
     But to resume,—should there be (what may not
       Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't,
     Because they can't find out the very spot
       Of that same Babel, or because they won't
     (Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got,
       And written lately two memoirs upon't),
     Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who
     Must be believed, though they believe not you,
     Yet let them think that Horace has exprest
       Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly
     Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,
       Who give themselves to architecture wholly;
     We know where things and men must end at best:
       A moral (like all morals) melancholy,
     And 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos'
     Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.
     At last they reach'd a quarter most retired,
       Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;
     Though full of all things which could be desired,
       One wonder'd what to do with such a number
     Of articles which nobody required;
       Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber
     With furniture an exquisite apartment,
     Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.
     It seem'd, however, but to open on
       A range or suite of further chambers, which
     Might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one
       The movables were prodigally rich:
     Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,
       So costly were they; carpets every stitch
     Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish
     You could glide o'er them like a golden fish.
     The black, however, without hardly deigning
       A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,
     Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,
       As if the milky way their feet was under
     With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining
       A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder—
     In that remote recess which you may see—
     Or if you don't the fault is not in me,—
     I wish to be perspicuous; and the black,
       I say, unlocking the recess, pull'd forth
     A quantity of clothes fit for the back
       Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth;
     And of variety there was no lack—
       And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,
     He chose himself to point out what he thought
     Most proper for the Christians he had bought.
     The suit he thought most suitable to each
       Was, for the elder and the stouter, first
     A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,
       And trousers not so tight that they would burst,
     But such as fit an Asiatic breech;
       A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst,
     Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;
     In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy.
     While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,
       Hinted the vast advantages which they
     Might probably attain both in the end,
       If they would but pursue the proper way
     Which fortune plainly seem'd to recommend;
       And then he added, that he needs must say,
     ''T would greatly tend to better their condition,
     If they would condescend to circumcision.
     'For his own part, he really should rejoice
       To see them true believers, but no less
     Would leave his proposition to their choice.'
       The other, thanking him for this excess
     Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice
       In such a trifle, scarcely could express
     'Sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation
     Of all the customs of this polish'd nation.
     'For his own share—he saw but small objection
       To so respectable an ancient rite;
     And, after swallowing down a slight refection,
       For which he own'd a present appetite,
     He doubted not a few hours of reflection
       Would reconcile him to the business quite.'
     'Will it?' said Juan, sharply: 'Strike me dead,
     But they as soon shall circumcise my head!
     'Cut off a thousand heads, before-'—'Now, pray,'
       Replied the other, 'do not interrupt:
     You put me out in what I had to say.
       Sir!—as I said, as soon as I have supt,
     I shall perpend if your proposal may
       Be such as I can properly accept;
     Provided always your great goodness still
     Remits the matter to our own free-will.'
     Baba eyed Juan, and said, 'Be so good
       As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit
     In which a Princess with great pleasure would
       Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,
     As not being in a masquerading mood,
       Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;
     And when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,'
     Replied, 'Old gentleman, I 'm not a lady.'
     'What you may be, I neither know nor care,'
       Said Baba; 'but pray do as I desire:
     I have no more time nor many words to spare.'
       'At least,' said Juan, 'sure I may enquire
     The cause of this odd travesty?'—'Forbear,'
       Said Baba, 'to be curious; 't will transpire,
     No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:
     I have no authority to tell the reason.'
     'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'—'Hold!'
       Rejoin'd the negro, 'pray be not provoking;
     This spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold,
       And you will find us not top fond of joking.'
     'What, sir!' said Juan, 'shall it e'er be told
       That I unsex'd my dress?' But Baba, stroking
     The things down, said, 'Incense me, and I call
     Those who will leave you of no sex at all.
     'I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:
       A woman's, true; but then there is a cause
     Why you should wear them.'—'What, though my soul loathes
       The effeminate garb?'—thus, after a short pause,
     Sigh'd Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,
       'What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?'
     Thus he profanely term'd the finest lace
     Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face.
     And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd
       A pair of trousers of flesh-colour'd silk;
     Next with a virgin zone he was equipp'd,
       Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;
     But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,
       Which—as we say—or, as the Scotch say, whilk
     (The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes
     Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)—
     Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to
       His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:
     And yet at last he managed to get through
       His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:
     The negro Baba help'd a little too,
       When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;
     And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,
     He paused, and took a survey up and down.
     One difficulty still remain'd—his hair
       Was hardly long enough; but Baba found
     So many false long tresses all to spare,
       That soon his head was most completely crown'd,
     After the manner then in fashion there;
       And this addition with such gems was bound
     As suited the ensemble of his toilet,
     While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.
     And now being femininely all array'd,
       With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,
     He look'd in almost all respects a maid,
       And Baba smilingly exclaim'd, 'You see, sirs,
     A perfect transformation here display'd;
       And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,
     That is—the Lady:' clapping his hands twice,
     Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.
     'You, sir,' said Baba, nodding to the one,
       'Will please to accompany those gentlemen
     To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,
       Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when
     I say a thing, it must at once be done.
       What fear you? think you this a lion's den?
     Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise
     Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.
     'You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.'
       'So much the better,' Juan said, 'for them;
     Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,
       Which is not quite so light as you may deem.
     I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm
       If any take me for that which I seem:
     So that I trust for everybody's sake,
     That this disguise may lead to no mistake.'
     'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while
       Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who
     Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile
       Upon the metamorphosis in view,—
     'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil
       Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;
     One 's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid,
     By this old black enchanter's unsought aid.'
     'Farewell!' said Juan: 'should we meet no more,
       I wish you a good appetite.'—'Farewell!'
     Replied the other; 'though it grieves me sore;
       When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:
     We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.
       Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.'
     'Nay,' quoth the maid, 'the Sultan's self shan't carry me,
     Unless his highness promises to marry me.
     And thus they parted, each by separate doors;
       Baba led Juan onward room by room
     Through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,
       Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,
     Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;
       And wafted far arose a rich perfume:
     It seem'd as though they came upon a shrine,
     For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.
     The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,
       Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;
     Warriors thereon were battling furiously;
       Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;
     There captives led in triumph droop the eye,
       And in perspective many a squadron flies:
     It seems the work of times before the line
     Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.
     This massy portal stood at the wide close
       Of a huge hall, and on its either side
     Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,
       Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied
     In mockery to the enormous gate which rose
       O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:
     The gate so splendid was in all its features,
     You never thought about those little creatures,
     Until you nearly trod on them, and then
       You started back in horror to survey
     The wondrous hideousness of those small men,
       Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,
     But an extraneous mixture, which no pen
       Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;
     They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb—
     Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.
     Their duty was—for they were strong, and though
       They look'd so little, did strong things at times—
     To ope this door, which they could really do,
       The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;
     And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,
       As is the custom of those Eastern climes,
     To give some rebel Pacha a cravat;
     For mutes are generally used for that.
     They spoke by signs—that is, not spoke at all;
       And looking like two incubi, they glared
     As Baba with his fingers made them fall
       To heaving back the portal folds: it scared
     Juan a moment, as this pair so small
       With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;
     It was as if their little looks could poison
     Or fascinate whome'er they fix'd their eyes on.
     Before they enter'd, Baba paused to hint
       To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:
     'If you could just contrive,' he said, 'to stint
       That somewhat manly majesty of stride,
     'T would be as well, and (though there 's not much in 't)
       To swing a little less from side to side,
     Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;—
     And also could you look a little modest,
     ''T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes
       Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;
     And if they should discover your disguise,
       You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;
     And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,
       To find our way to Marmora without boats,
     Stitch'd up in sacks—a mode of navigation
     A good deal practised here upon occasion.'
     With this encouragement, he led the way
       Into a room still nobler than the last;
     A rich confusion form'd a disarray
       In such sort, that the eye along it cast
     Could hardly carry anything away,
       Object on object flash'd so bright and fast;
     A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,
     Magnificently mingled in a litter.
     Wealth had done wonders—taste not much; such things
       Occur in Orient palaces, and even
     In the more chasten'd domes of Western kings
       (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),
     Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings
       Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;
     Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,
     On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.
     In this imperial hall, at distance lay
       Under a canopy, and there reclined
     Quite in a confidential queenly way,
       A lady; Baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd
     To Juan, who though not much used to pray,
       Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,
     What all this meant: while Baba bow'd and bended
     His head, until the ceremony ended.
     The lady rising up with such an air
       As Venus rose with from the wave, on them
     Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair
       Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;
     And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,
       She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem
     Of her deep purple robe, and speaking low,
     Pointed to Juan who remain'd below.
     Her presence was as lofty as her state;
       Her beauty of that overpowering kind,
     Whose force description only would abate:
       I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,
     Than lessen it by what I could relate
       Of forms and features; it would strike you blind
     Could I do justice to the full detail;
     So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.
     Thus much however I may add,—her years
       Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;
     But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,
       And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,
     Such as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true—tears
       And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings
     Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow
     Ugly; for instance—Ninon de l'Enclos.
     She spake some words to her attendants, who
       Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,
     And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,
       Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen;
     They form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,
       Which might have call'd Diana's chorus 'cousin,'
     As far as outward show may correspond;
     I won't be bail for anything beyond.
     They bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring,
       But not by the same door through which came in
     Baba and Juan, which last stood admiring,
       At some small distance, all he saw within
     This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring
       Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;
     And I must say, I ne'er could see the very
     Great happiness of the 'Nil Admirari.'
     'Not to admire is all the art I know
       (Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech)
     To make men happy, or to keep them so'
       (So take it in the very words of Creech)—
     Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago;
       And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach
     From his translation; but had none admired,
     Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?
     Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,
       Motion'd to Juan to approach, and then
     A second time desired him to kneel down,
       And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when
     He heard repeated, Juan with a frown
       Drew himself up to his full height again,
     And said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop
     To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.'
     Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,
       Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat
     He mutter'd (but the last was given aside)
       About a bow-string—quite in vain; not yet
     Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:
       There 's nothing in the world like etiquette
     In kingly chambers or imperial halls,
     As also at the race and county balls.
     He stood like Atlas, with a world of words
       About his ears, and nathless would not bend:
     The blood of all his line 's Castilian lords
       Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend
     To stain his pedigree a thousand swords
       A thousand times of him had made an end;
     At length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,
     Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand.
     Here was an honourable compromise,
       A half-way house of diplomatic rest,
     Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;
       And Juan now his willingness exprest
     To use all fit and proper courtesies,
       Adding, that this was commonest and best,
     For through the South the custom still commands
     The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.
     And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,
       Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers
     No lips e'er left their transitory trace;
       On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,
     And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,
       As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers
     In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's
     An almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers.
     The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade
       Baba retire, which he obey'd in style,
     As if well used to the retreating trade;
       And taking hints in good part all the while,
     He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,
       And looking on him with a sort of smile,
     Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction
     As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.
     When he was gone, there was a sudden change:
       I know not what might be the lady's thought,
     But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,
       And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,
     Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range
       The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,
     A mixture of sensations might be scann'd,
     Of half voluptuousness and half command.
     Her form had all the softness of her sex,
       Her features all the sweetness of the devil,
     When he put on the cherub to perplex
       Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;
     The sun himself was scarce more free from specks
       Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;
     Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,
     As if she rather order'd than was granting.
     Something imperial, or imperious, threw
       A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain
     Was thrown as 't were about the neck of you,—
       And rapture's self will seem almost a pain
     With aught which looks like despotism in view:
       Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain
     We would against them make the flesh obey—
     The spirit in the end will have its way.
     Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;
       Her very nod was not an inclination;
     There was a self-will even in her small feet,
       As though they were quite conscious of her station—
     They trod as upon necks; and to complete
       Her state (it is the custom of her nation),
     A poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign
     She was a sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).
     'To hear and to obey' had been from birth
       The law of all around her; to fulfill
     All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,
       Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;
     Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:
       Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;
     Had she but been a Christian, I 've a notion
     We should have found out the 'perpetual motion.'
     Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;
       Whate'er she did not see, if she supposed
     It might be seen, with diligence was sought,
       And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;
     There was no end unto the things she bought,
       Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;
     Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,
     The women pardon'd all except her face.
     Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught
       Her eye in passing on his way to sale;
     She order'd him directly to be bought,
       And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail
     In any kind of mischief to be wrought,
       At all such auctions knew how to prevail:
     She had no prudence, but he had; and this
     Explains the garb which Juan took amiss.
     His youth and features favour'd the disguise,
       And, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride,
     Could risk or compass such strange phantasies,
       This I must leave sultanas to decide:
     Emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,
       And kings and consorts oft are mystified,
     As we may ascertain with due precision,
     Some by experience, others by tradition.
     But to the main point, where we have been tending:—
       She now conceived all difficulties past,
     And deem'd herself extremely condescending
       When, being made her property at last,
     Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending
       Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,
     And merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?'
     Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move
     And so it was, in proper time and place;
       But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing
     With Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face,
       Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,
     Rush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace,
       And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;
     These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,
     So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.
     She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,
       For women shed and use them at their liking;
     But there is something when man's eye appears
       Wet, still more disagreeable and striking;
     A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,
       Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in
     His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)
     To them 't is a relief, to us a torture.
     And she would have consoled, but knew not how:
       Having no equals, nothing which had e'er
     Infected her with sympathy till now,
       And never having dreamt what 't was to bear
     Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although
       There might arise some pouting petty care
     To cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near
     Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.
     But nature teaches more than power can spoil,
       And, when a strong although a strange sensation
     Moves—female hearts are such a genial soil
       For kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation,
     They naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'
       Samaritans in every situation;
     And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,
     Felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye.
     But tears must stop like all things else; and soon
       Juan, who for an instant had been moved
     To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone
       Of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,'
     Call'd back the stoic to his eyes, which shone
       Bright with the very weakness he reproved;
     And although sensitive to beauty, he
     Felt most indignant still at not being free.
     Gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,
       Was much embarrass'd, never having met
     In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;
       And as she also risk'd her life to get
     Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways
       Into a comfortable tete-a-tete,
     To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,
     And they had wasted now almost a quarter.
     I also would suggest the fitting time
       To gentlemen in any such like case,
     That is to say in a meridian clime—
       With us there is more law given to the chase,
     But here a small delay forms a great crime:
       So recollect that the extremest grace
     Is just two minutes for your declaration—
     A moment more would hurt your reputation.
     Juan's was good; and might have been still better,
       But he had got Haidee into his head:
     However strange, he could not yet forget her,
       Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.
     Gulbeyaz, who look'd on him as her debtor
       For having had him to her palace led,
     Began to blush up to the eyes, and then
     Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again.
     At length, in an imperial way, she laid
       Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes
     Which needed not an empire to persuade,
       Look'd into his for love, where none replies:
     Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,
       That being the last thing a proud woman tries;
     She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw
     Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.
     This was an awkward test, as Juan found,
       But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:
     With gentle force her white arms he unwound,
       And seated her all drooping by his side,
     Then rising haughtily he glanced around,
       And looking coldly in her face, he cried,
     'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor
     Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.
     'Thou ask'st if I can love? be this the proof
       How much I have loved—that I love not thee!
     In this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,
       Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!
     I am not dazzled by this splendid roof,
       Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be;
     Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,
     And hands obey—our hearts are still our own.'
     This was a truth to us extremely trite;
       Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:
     She deem'd her least command must yield delight,
       Earth being only made for queens and kings.
     If hearts lay on the left side or the right
       She hardly knew, to such perfection brings
     Legitimacy its born votaries, when
     Aware of their due royal rights o'er men.
     Besides, as has been said, she was so fair
       As even in a much humbler lot had made
     A kingdom or confusion anywhere,
       And also, as may be presumed, she laid
     Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,
       By their possessors thrown into the shade:
     She thought hers gave a double 'right divine;'
     And half of that opinion 's also mine.
     Remember, or (if you can not) imagine,
       Ye, who have kept your chastity when young,
     While some more desperate dowager has been waging
       Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung
     By your refusal, recollect her raging!
       Or recollect all that was said or sung
     On such a subject; then suppose the face
     Of a young downright beauty in this case.
     Suppose,—but you already have supposed,
       The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,
     Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed
       Of good examples; pity that so few by
     Poets and private tutors are exposed,
       To educate—ye youth of Europe—you by!
     But when you have supposed the few we know,
     You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.
     A tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,
       Or any interesting beast of prey,
     Are similes at hand for the distress
       Of ladies who can not have their own way;
     But though my turn will not be served with less,
       These don't express one half what I should say:
     For what is stealing young ones, few or many,
     To cutting short their hopes of having any?
     The love of offspring 's nature's general law,
       From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;
     There 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw
       Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;
     And all who have seen a human nursery, saw
       How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;
     This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer
     Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.
     If I said fire flash'd from Gulbeyaz' eyes,
       'T were nothing—for her eyes flash'd always fire;
     Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,
       I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,
     So supernatural was her passion's rise;
       For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:
     Even ye who know what a check'd woman is
     (Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.
     Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well—
       A moment's more had slain her; but the while
     It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:
       Nought 's more sublime than energetic bile,
     Though horrible to see yet grand to tell,
       Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;
     And the deep passions flashing through her form
     Made her a beautiful embodied storm.
     A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon
       To match a common fury with her rage,
     And yet she did not want to reach the moon,
       Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;
     Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,
       Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age—
     Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,
     And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.
     A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,
       Pass'd without words—in fact she could not speak;
     And then her sex's shame broke in at last,
       A sentiment till then in her but weak,
     But now it flow'd in natural and fast,
       As water through an unexpected leak;
     For she felt humbled—and humiliation
     Is sometimes good for people in her station
     It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,
       It also gently hints to them that others,
     Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;
       That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,
     And works of the same pottery, bad or good,
       Though not all born of the same sires and mothers:
     It teaches—Heaven knows only what it teaches,
     But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.
     Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;
       Her second, to cut only his—acquaintance;
     Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;
       Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;
     Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;
       Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence
     The lash to Baba:—but her grand resource
     Was to sit down again, and cry of course.
     She thought to stab herself, but then she had
       The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;
     For Eastern stays are little made to pad,
       So that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard:
     She thought of killing Juan—but, poor lad!
       Though he deserved it well for being so backward,
     The cutting off his head was not the art
     Most likely to attain her aim—his heart.
     Juan was moved; he had made up his mind
       To be impaled, or quarter'd as a dish
     For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,
       Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,
     And thus heroically stood resign'd,
       Rather than sin—except to his own wish:
     But all his great preparatives for dying
     Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.
     As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,
       So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how;
     And first he wonder'd why he had refused;
       And then, if matters could be made up now;
     And next his savage virtue he accused,
       Just as a friar may accuse his vow,
     Or as a dame repents her of her oath,
     Which mostly ends in some small breach of both.
     So he began to stammer some excuses;
       But words are not enough in such a matter,
     Although you borrow'd all that e'er the muses
       Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,
     Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses;
       Just as a languid smile began to flatter
     His peace was making, but before he ventured
     Further, old Baba rather briskly enter'd.
     'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!'
       ('T was thus he spake) 'and Empress of the Earth!
     Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,
       Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,
     Your slave brings tidings—he hopes not too soon—
       Which your sublime attention may be worth:
     The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,
     To hint that he is coming up this way.'
     'Is it,' exclaim'd Gulbeyaz, 'as you say?
       I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!
     But bid my women form the milky way.
       Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning—
     And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,
       And as you 'd have me pardon your past scorning-'
     Here they were interrupted by a humming
     Sound, and then by a cry, 'The Sultan 's coming!'
     First came her damsels, a decorous file,
       And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;
     The train might reach a quarter of a mile:
       His majesty was always so polite
     As to announce his visits a long while
       Before he came, especially at night;
     For being the last wife of the Emperour,
     She was of course the favorite of the four.
     His Highness was a man of solemn port,
       Shawl'd to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,
     Snatch'd from a prison to preside at court,
       His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;
     He was as good a sovereign of the sort
       As any mention'd in the histories
     Of Cantemir, or Knolles, where few shine
     Save Solyman, the glory of their line.
     He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers
       With more than 'Oriental scrupulosity;'
     He left to his vizier all state affairs,
       And show'd but little royal curiosity:
     I know not if he had domestic cares—
       No process proved connubial animosity;
     Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,
     Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.
     If now and then there happen'd a slight slip,
       Little was heard of criminal or crime;
     The story scarcely pass'd a single lip—
       The sack and sea had settled all in time,
     From which the secret nobody could rip:
       The Public knew no more than does this rhyme;
     No scandals made the daily press a curse—
     Morals were better, and the fish no worse.
     He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,
       Was also certain that the earth was square,
     Because he had journey'd fifty miles, and found
       No sign that it was circular anywhere;
     His empire also was without a bound:
       'T is true, a little troubled here and there,
     By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,
     But then they never came to 'the Seven Towers;'
     Except in shape of envoys, who were sent
       To lodge there when a war broke out, according
     To the true law of nations, which ne'er meant
       Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in
     Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent
       Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording
     Their lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or
     The singeing of a single inky whisker.
     He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,
       Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,
     The former in a palace, where like nuns
       They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,
     When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,
       Sometimes at six years old—though it seems odd,
     'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw
     Must make a present to his sire in law.
     His sons were kept in prison, till they grew
       Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,
     One or the other, but which of the two
       Could yet be known unto the fates alone;
     Meantime the education they went through
       Was princely, as the proofs have always shown:
     So that the heir apparent still was found
     No less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd.
     His majesty saluted his fourth spouse
       With all the ceremonies of his rank,
     Who clear'd her sparkling eyes and smooth'd her brows,
       As suits a matron who has play'd a prank;
     These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,
       To save the credit of their breaking bank:
     To no men are such cordial greetings given
     As those whose wives have made them fit for heaven.
     His Highness cast around his great black eyes,
       And looking, as he always look'd, perceived
     Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,
       At which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved,
     But just remark'd with air sedate and wise,
       While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,
     'I see you 've bought another girl; 't is pity
     That a mere Christian should be half so pretty.'
     This compliment, which drew all eyes upon
       The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.
     Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:
       O! Mahomet! that his majesty should take
     Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one
       Of them his lips imperial ever spake!
     There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,
     But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.
     The Turks do well to shut—at least, sometimes—
       The women up, because, in sad reality,
     Their chastity in these unhappy climes
       Is not a thing of that astringent quality
     Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,
       And makes our snow less pure than our morality;
     The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,
     Has quite the contrary effect on vice.
     Thus in the East they are extremely strict,
       And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;
     Excepting only when the former 's pick'd
       It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;
     Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:
       But then their own Polygamy 's to blame;
     Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life
     Into that moral centaur, man and wife?
     Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,
       Though not for want of matter; but 't is time
     According to the ancient epic laws,
       To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.
     Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,
       The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;
     Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps
     You 'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.
CANTO THE SIXTH.
    'There is a tide in the affairs of men
       Which,—taken at the flood,'—you know the rest,
     And most of us have found it now and then;
       At least we think so, though but few have guess'd
     The moment, till too late to come again.
       But no doubt every thing is for the best—
     Of which the surest sign is in the end:
     When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.
     There is a tide in the affairs of women
       Which, taken at the flood, leads—God knows where:
     Those navigators must be able seamen
       Whose charts lay down its current to a hair;
     Not all the reveries of Jacob Behmen
       With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:
     Men with their heads reflect on this and that—
     But women with their hearts on heaven knows what!
     And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,
       Young, beautiful, and daring—who would risk
     A throne, the world, the universe, to be
       Beloved in her own way, and rather whisk
     The stars from out the sky, than not be free
       As are the billows when the breeze is brisk—
     Though such a she 's a devil (if that there be one),
     Yet she would make full many a Manichean.
     Thrones, worlds, et cetera, are so oft upset
       By commonest ambition, that when passion
     O'erthrows the same, we readily forget,
       Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.
     If Antony be well remember'd yet,
       'Tis not his conquests keep his name in fashion,
     But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,
     Outbalances all Caesar's victories.
     He died at fifty for a queen of forty;
       I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,
     For then wealth, kingdoms, worlds are but a sport—I
       Remember when, though I had no great plenty
     Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I
       Gave what I had—a heart: as the world went, I
     Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never
     Restore me those pure feelings, gone forever.
     'Twas the boy's 'mite,' and, like the 'widow's,' may
       Perhaps be weigh'd hereafter, if not now;
     But whether such things do or do not weigh,
       All who have loved, or love, will still allow
     Life has nought like it. God is love, they say,
       And Love 's a god, or was before the brow
     Of earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears
     Of—but Chronology best knows the years.
     We left our hero and third heroine in
       A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,
     For gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin
       For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:
     Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,
       And don't agree at all with the wise Roman,
     Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,
     Who lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.
     I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;
       I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;
     But I detest all fiction even in song,
       And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.
     Her reason being weak, her passions strong,
       She thought that her lord's heart (even could she claim it)
     Was scarce enough; for he had fifty-nine
     Years, and a fifteen-hundredth concubine.
     I am not, like Cassio, 'an arithmetician,'
       But by 'the bookish theoric' it appears,
     If 'tis summ'd up with feminine precision,
       That, adding to the account his Highness' years,
     The fair Sultana err'd from inanition;
       For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,
     She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part
     Of what should be monopoly—the heart.
     It is observed that ladies are litigious
       Upon all legal objects of possession,
     And not the least so when they are religious,
       Which doubles what they think of the transgression:
     With suits and prosecutions they besiege us,
       As the tribunals show through many a session,
     When they suspect that any one goes shares
     In that to which the law makes them sole heirs.
     Now, if this holds good in a Christian land,
       The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,
     Are apt to carry things with a high hand,
       And take what kings call 'an imposing attitude,'
     And for their rights connubial make a stand,
       When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude:
     And as four wives must have quadruple claims,
     The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.
     Gulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)
       The favourite; but what 's favour amongst four?
     Polygamy may well be held in dread,
       Not only as a sin, but as a bore:
     Most wise men, with one moderate woman wed,
       Will scarcely find philosophy for more;
     And all (except Mahometans) forbear
     To make the nuptial couch a 'Bed of Ware.'
     His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,—
       So styled according to the usual forms
     Of every monarch, till they are consign'd
       To those sad hungry jacobins the worms,
     Who on the very loftiest kings have dined,—
       His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,
     Expecting all the welcome of a lover
     (A 'Highland welcome' all the wide world over).
     Now here we should distinguish; for howe'er
       Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,
     May look like what is—neither here nor there,
       They are put on as easily as a hat,
     Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,
       Trimm'd either heads or hearts to decorate,
     Which form an ornament, but no more part
     Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.
     A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind
       Of gentle feminine delight, and shown
     More in the eyelids than the eyes, resign'd
       Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,
     Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)
       Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,
     A sincere woman's breast,—for over-warm
     Or over-cold annihilates the charm.
     For over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;
       If true, 'tis no great lease of its own fire;
     For no one, save in very early youth,
       Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,
     Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,
       And apt to be transferr'd to the first buyer
     At a sad discount: while your over chilly
     Women, on t' other hand, seem somewhat silly.
     That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,
       For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,
     Who fain would have a mutual flame confess'd,
       And see a sentimental passion glow,
     Even were St. Francis' paramour their guest,
       In his monastic concubine of snow;—
     In short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is
     Horatian, 'Medio tu tutissimus ibis.'
     The 'tu' 's too much,—but let it stand,—the verse
       Requires it, that 's to say, the English rhyme,
     And not the pink of old hexameters;
       But, after all, there 's neither tune nor time
     In the last line, which cannot well be worse,
       And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:
     I own no prosody can ever rate it
     As a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.
     If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,
       I know not—it succeeded, and success
     Is much in most things, not less in the heart
       Than other articles of female dress.
     Self-love in man, too, beats all female art;
       They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;
     And no one virtue yet, except starvation,
     Could stop that worst of vices—propagation.
     We leave this royal couple to repose:
       A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,
     Whate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:
       Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep
     As any man's day mixture undergoes.
       Our least of sorrows are such as we weep;
     'Tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears
     The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.
     A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill
       To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted
     At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,
       A favourite horse fallen lame just as he 's mounted,
     A bad old woman making a worse will,
       Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted
     As certain;—these are paltry things, and yet
     I 've rarely seen the man they did not fret.
     I 'm a philosopher; confound them all!
       Bills, beasts, and men, and—no! not womankind!
     With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,
       And then my stoicism leaves nought behind
     Which it can either pain or evil call,
       And I can give my whole soul up to mind;
     Though what is soul or mind, their birth or growth,
     Is more than I know—the deuce take them both!
       As after reading Athanasius' curse,
     Which doth your true believer so much please:
       I doubt if any now could make it worse
     O'er his worst enemy when at his knees,
       'Tis so sententious, positive, and terse,
     And decorates the book of Common Prayer,
     As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.
     Gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or
       At least one of them!—Oh, the heavy night,
     When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,
       Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light
     Of the gray morning, and look vainly for
       Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite—
     To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake
     Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!
     These are beneath the canopy of heaven,
       Also beneath the canopy of beds
     Four-posted and silk curtain'd, which are given
       For rich men and their brides to lay their heads
     Upon, in sheets white as what bards call 'driven
       Snow.' Well! 'tis all hap-hazard when one weds.
     Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been
     Perhaps as wretched if a peasant's quean.
     Don Juan in his feminine disguise,
       With all the damsels in their long array,
     Had bow'd themselves before th' imperial eyes,
       And at the usual signal ta'en their way
     Back to their chambers, those long galleries
       In the seraglio, where the ladies lay
     Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there
     Beating for love, as the caged bird's for air.
     I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse
       The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had
     One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:'
       My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,
     And much more tender on the whole than fierce;
       It being (not now, but only while a lad)
     That womankind had but one rosy mouth,
     To kiss them all at once from North to South.
     O, enviable Briareus! with thy hands
       And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied
     In such proportion!—But my Muse withstands
       The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,
     Or travelling in Patagonian lands;
       So let us back to Lilliput, and guide
     Our hero through the labyrinth of love
     In which we left him several lines above.
     He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,
       At the given signal join'd to their array;
     And though he certainly ran many risks,
       Yet he could not at times keep, by the way
     (Although the consequences of such frisks
       Are worse than the worst damages men pay
     In moral England, where the thing 's a tax),
     From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.
     Still he forgot not his disguise:—along
       The galleries from room to room they walk'd,
     A virgin-like and edifying throng,
       By eunuchs flank'd; while at their head there stalk'd
     A dame who kept up discipline among
       The female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd
     Without her sanction on their she-parades:
     Her title was 'the Mother of the Maids.'
     Whether she was a 'mother,' I know not,
       Or whether they were 'maids' who call'd her mother;
     But this is her seraglio title, got
       I know not how, but good as any other;
     So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:
       Her office was to keep aloof or smother
     All bad propensities in fifteen hundred
     Young women, and correct them when they blunder'd.
     A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made
       More easy by the absence of all men—
     Except his majesty, who, with her aid,
       And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then
     A slight example, just to cast a shade
       Along the rest, contrived to keep this den
     Of beauties cool as an Italian convent,
     Where all the passions have, alas! but one vent.
     And what is that? Devotion, doubtless—how
       Could you ask such a question?—but we will
     Continue. As I said, this goodly row
       Of ladies of all countries at the will
     Of one good man, with stately march and slow,
       Like water-lilies floating down a rill—
     Or rather lake, for rills do not run slowly—
     Paced on most maiden-like and melancholy.
     But when they reach'd their own apartments, there,
       Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,
     Waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere
       When freed from bonds (which are of no great use
     After all), or like Irish at a fair,
       Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce
     Establish'd between them and bondage, they
     Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.
     Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;
       Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:
     Some thought her dress did not so much become her,
       Or wonder'd at her ears without a ring;
     Some said her years were getting nigh their summer,
       Others contended they were but in spring;
     Some thought her rather masculine in height,
     While others wish'd that she had been so quite.
     But no one doubted on the whole, that she
       Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,
     And fresh, and 'beautiful exceedingly,'
       Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:
     They wonder'd how Gulbeyaz, too, could be
       So silly as to buy slaves who might share
     (If that his Highness wearied of his bride)
     Her throne and power, and every thing beside.
     But what was strangest in this virgin crew,
       Although her beauty was enough to vex,
     After the first investigating view,
       They all found out as few, or fewer, specks
     In the fair form of their companion new,
       Than is the custom of the gentle sex,
     When they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,
     In a new face 'the ugliest creature breathing.'
     And yet they had their little jealousies,
       Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,
     Whether there are such things as sympathies
       Without our knowledge or our approbation,
     Although they could not see through his disguise,
       All felt a soft kind of concatenation,
     Like magnetism, or devilism, or what
     You please—we will not quarrel about that:
     But certain 'tis they all felt for their new
       Companion something newer still, as 'twere
     A sentimental friendship through and through,
       Extremely pure, which made them all concur
     In wishing her their sister, save a few
       Who wish'd they had a brother just like her,
     Whom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,
     They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.
     Of those who had most genius for this sort
       Of sentimental friendship, there were three,
     Lolah, Katinka, and Dudu; in short
       (To save description), fair as fair can be
     Were they, according to the best report,
       Though differing in stature and degree,
     And clime and time, and country and complexion;
     They all alike admired their new connection.
     Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;
       Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,
     With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,
       And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,
     But rather skim the earth; while Dudu's form
       Look'd more adapted to be put to bed,
     Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,
     Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.
     A kind of sleepy Venus seem'd Dudu,
       Yet very fit to 'murder sleep' in those
     Who gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,
       Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:
     Few angles were there in her form, 'tis true,
       Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;
     Yet, after all, 'twould puzzle to say where
     It would not spoil some separate charm to pare.
     She was not violently lively, but
       Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;
     Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,
       They put beholders in a tender taking;
     She look'd (this simile 's quite new) just cut
       From marble, like Pygmalion's statue waking,
     The mortal and the marble still at strife,
     And timidly expanding into life.
     Lolah demanded the new damsel's name—
       'Juanna.'—Well, a pretty name enough.
     Katinka ask'd her also whence she came—
       'From Spain.'—'But where is Spain?'—'Don't ask such stuff,
     Nor show your Georgian ignorance—for shame!'
       Said Lolah, with an accent rather rough,
     To poor Katinka: 'Spain 's an island near
     Morocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier.'
     Dudu said nothing, but sat down beside
       Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;
     And looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,
       As if she pitied her for being there,
     A pretty stranger without friend or guide,
       And all abash'd, too, at the general stare
     Which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,
     With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.
     But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,
       With, 'Ladies, it is time to go to rest.
     I 'm puzzled what to do with you, my dear,'
       She added to Juanna, their new guest:
     'Your coming has been unexpected here,
       And every couch is occupied; you had best
     Partake of mine; but by to-morrow early
     We will have all things settled for you fairly.'
     Here Lolah interposed—'Mamma, you know
       You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear
     That anybody should disturb you so;
       I 'll take Juanna; we 're a slenderer pair
     Than you would make the half of;—don't say no;
       And I of your young charge will take due care.'
     But here Katinka interfered, and said,
     'She also had compassion and a bed.
     'Besides, I hate to sleep alone,' quoth she.
       The matron frown'd: 'Why so?'—'For fear of ghosts,'
     Replied Katinka; 'I am sure I see
       A phantom upon each of the four posts;
     And then I have the worst dreams that can be,
       Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts.'
     The dame replied, 'Between your dreams and you,
     I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.
     'You, Lolah, must continue still to lie
       Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you
     The same, Katinka, until by and by;
       And I shall place Juanna with Dudu,
     Who 's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,
       And will not toss and chatter the night through.
     What say you, child?'—Dudu said nothing, as
     Her talents were of the more silent class;
     But she rose up, and kiss'd the matron's brow
       Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,
     Katinka, too; and with a gentle bow
       (Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)
     She took Juanna by the hand to show
       Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,
     The others pouting at the matron's preference
     Of Dudu, though they held their tongues from deference.
     It was a spacious chamber (Oda is
       The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall
     Were couches, toilets—and much more than this
       I might describe, as I have seen it all,
     But it suffices—little was amiss;
       'Twas on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,
     With all things ladies want, save one or two,
     And even those were nearer than they knew.
     Dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,
       Not very dashing, but extremely winning,
     With the most regulated charms of feature,
       Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning
     Against proportion—the wild strokes of nature
       Which they hit off at once in the beginning,
     Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,
     And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.
     But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,
       Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,
     Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,
       Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it
     Than are your mighty passions and so forth,
       Which some call 'the sublime:' I wish they 'd try it:
     I 've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,
     And pity lovers rather more than seamen.
     But she was pensive more than melancholy,
       And serious more than pensive, and serene,
     It may be, more than either—not unholy
       Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.
     The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly
       Unconscious, albeit turn'd of quick seventeen,
     That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;
     She never thought about herself at all.
     And therefore was she kind and gentle as
       The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,
     By which its nomenclature came to pass;
       Thus most appropriately has been shown
     'Lucus a non lucendo,' not what was,
       But what was not; a sort of style that 's grown
     Extremely common in this age, whose metal
     The devil may decompose, but never settle:
     I think it may be of 'Corinthian Brass,'
       Which was a mixture of all metals, but
     The brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass
       This long parenthesis: I could not shut
     It sooner for the soul of me, and class
       My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put
     A kind construction upon them and me:
     But that you won't—then don't—I am not less free.
     'Tis time we should return to plain narration,
       And thus my narrative proceeds:—Dudu,
     With every kindness short of ostentation,
       Show'd Juan, or Juanna, through and through
     This labyrinth of females, and each station
       Described—what 's strange—in words extremely few:
     I have but one simile, and that 's a blunder,
     For wordless woman, which is silent thunder.
     And next she gave her (I say her, because
       The gender still was epicene, at least
     In outward show, which is a saving clause)
       An outline of the customs of the East,
     With all their chaste integrity of laws,
       By which the more a haram is increased,
     The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties
     Of any supernumerary beauties.
     And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:
       Dudu was fond of kissing—which I 'm sure
     That nobody can ever take amiss,
       Because 'tis pleasant, so that it be pure,
     And between females means no more than this—
       That they have nothing better near, or newer.
     'Kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse—
     I wish it never led to something worse.
     In perfect innocence she then unmade
       Her toilet, which cost little, for she was
     A child of Nature, carelessly array'd:
       If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,
     'Twas like the fawn, which, in the lake display'd,
       Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,
     When first she starts, and then returns to peep,
     Admiring this new native of the deep.
     And one by one her articles of dress
       Were laid aside; but not before she offer'd
     Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess
       Of modesty declined the assistance proffer'd:
     Which pass'd well off—as she could do no less;
       Though by this politesse she rather suffer'd,
     Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,
     Which surely were invented for our sins,—
     Making a woman like a porcupine,
       Not to be rashly touch'd. But still more dread,
     O ye! whose fate it is, as once 'twas mine,
       In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;—
     I did my very boyish best to shine
       In tricking her out for a masquerade;
     The pins were placed sufficiently, but not
     Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.
     But these are foolish things to all the wise,
       And I love wisdom more than she loves me;
     My tendency is to philosophise
       On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;
     But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.
       What are we? and whence came we? what shall be
     Our ultimate existence? what 's our present?
     Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.
     There was deep silence in the chamber: dim
       And distant from each other burn'd the lights,
     And slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb
       Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,
     They should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,
       By way of change from their sepulchral sites,
     And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste
     Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.
     Many and beautiful lay those around,
       Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,
     In some exotic garden sometimes found,
       With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.
     One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,
       And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit
     Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,
     And lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath.
     One with her flush'd cheek laid on her white arm,
       And raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd
     Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;
       And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud
     The moon breaks, half unveil'd each further charm,
       As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,
     Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night
     All bashfully to struggle into light.
     This is no bull, although it sounds so; for
       'Twas night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.
     A third's all pallid aspect offer'd more
       The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd
     Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore
       Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd
     (As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges
     The black bough) tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes.
     A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,
       Lay in a breathless, hush'd, and stony sleep;
     White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,
       Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,
     Or Lot's wife done in salt,—or what you will;—
       My similes are gather'd in a heap,
     So pick and choose—perhaps you 'll be content
     With a carved lady on a monument.
     And lo! a fifth appears;—and what is she?
       A lady of a 'certain age,' which means
     Certainly aged—what her years might be
       I know not, never counting past their teens;
     But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,
       As ere that awful period intervenes
     Which lays both men and women on the shelf,
     To meditate upon their sins and self.
     But all this time how slept, or dream'd, Dudu?
       With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,
     And scorn to add a syllable untrue;
       But ere the middle watch was hardly over,
     Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,
       And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,
     To those who like their company, about
     The apartment, on a sudden she scream'd out:
     And that so loudly, that upstarted all
       The Oda, in a general commotion:
     Matron and maids, and those whom you may call
       Neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,
     One on the other, throughout the whole hall,
       All trembling, wondering, without the least notion
     More than I have myself of what could make
     The calm Dudu so turbulently wake.
     But wide awake she was, and round her bed,
       With floating draperies and with flying hair,
     With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,
       And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,
     And bright as any meteor ever bred
       By the North Pole,—they sought her cause of care,
     For she seem'd agitated, flush'd, and frighten'd,
     Her eye dilated and her colour heighten'd.
     But what was strange—and a strong proof how great
       A blessing is sound sleep—Juanna lay
     As fast as ever husband by his mate
       In holy matrimony snores away.
     Not all the clamour broke her happy state
       Of slumber, ere they shook her,—so they say
     At least,—and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,
     And yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise.
     And now commenced a strict investigation,
       Which, as all spoke at once and more than once,
     Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,
       Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce
     To answer in a very clear oration.
       Dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,
     But, being 'no orator as Brutus is,'
     Could not at first expound what was amiss.
     At length she said, that in a slumber sound
       She dream'd a dream, of walking in a wood—
     A 'wood obscure,' like that where Dante found
       Himself in at the age when all grow good;
     Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crown'd
       Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;
     And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,
     And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;
     And in the midst a golden apple grew,—
       A most prodigious pippin,—but it hung
     Rather too high and distant; that she threw
       Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung
     Stones and whatever she could pick up, to
       Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung
     To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,
     But always at a most provoking height;—
     That on a sudden, when she least had hope,
       It fell down of its own accord before
     Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop
       And pick it up, and bite it to the core;
     That just as her young lip began to ope
       Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,
     A bee flew out and stung her to the heart,
     And so—she awoke with a great scream and start.
     All this she told with some confusion and
       Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams
     Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand
       To expound their vain and visionary gleams.
     I 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd
       Prophetically, or that which one deems
     A 'strange coincidence,' to use a phrase
     By which such things are settled now-a-days.
     The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,
       Began, as is the consequence of fear,
     To scold a little at the false alarm
       That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.
     The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm
       Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,
     And chafed at poor Dudu, who only sigh'd,
     And said that she was sorry she had cried.
     'I 've heard of stories of a cock and bull;
       But visions of an apple and a bee,
     To take us from our natural rest, and pull
       The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,
     Would make us think the moon is at its full.
       You surely are unwell, child! we must see,
     To-morrow, what his Highness's physician
     Will say to this hysteric of a vision.
     'And poor Juanna, too—the child's first night
       Within these walls to be broke in upon
     With such a clamour! I had thought it right
       That the young stranger should not lie alone,
     And, as the quietest of all, she might
       With you, Dudu, a good night's rest have known;
     But now I must transfer her to the charge
     Of Lolah—though her couch is not so large.'
     Lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;
       But poor Dudu, with large drops in her own,
     Resulting from the scolding or the vision,
       Implored that present pardon might be shown
     For this first fault, and that on no condition
       (She added in a soft and piteous tone)
     Juanna should be taken from her, and
     Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.
     She promised never more to have a dream,
       At least to dream so loudly as just now;
     She wonder'd at herself how she could scream—
       'Twas foolish, nervous, as she must allow,
     A fond hallucination, and a theme
       For laughter—but she felt her spirits low,
     And begg'd they would excuse her; she 'd get over
     This weakness in a few hours, and recover.
     And here Juanna kindly interposed,
       And said she felt herself extremely well
     Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed
       When all around rang like a tocsin bell:
     She did not find herself the least disposed
       To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell
     Apart from one who had no sin to show,
     Save that of dreaming once 'mal-a-propos.'
     As thus Juanna spoke, Dudu turn'd round
       And hid her face within Juanna's breast:
     Her neck alone was seen, but that was found
       The colour of a budding rose's crest.
     I can't tell why she blush'd, nor can expound
       The mystery of this rupture of their rest;
     All that I know is, that the facts I state
     Are true as truth has ever been of late.
     And so good night to them,—or, if you will,
       Good morrow—for the cock had crown, and light
     Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,
       And the mosque crescent struggled into sight
     Of the long caravan, which in the chill
       Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height
     That stretches to the stony belt, which girds
     Asia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.
     With the first ray, or rather grey of morn,
       Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale
     As passion rises, with its bosom worn,
       Array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil.
     The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,
       Which fable places in her breast of wail,
     Is lighter far of heart and voice than those
     Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.
     And that 's the moral of this composition,
       If people would but see its real drift;—
     But that they will not do without suspicion,
       Because all gentle readers have the gift
     Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;
       While gentle writers also love to lift
     Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,
     The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.
     Rose the sultana from a bed of splendour,
       Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried
     Aloud because his feelings were too tender
       To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,—
     So beautiful that art could little mend her,
       Though pale with conflicts between love and pride;—
     So agitated was she with her error,
     She did not even look into the mirror.
     Also arose about the self-same time,
       Perhaps a little later, her great lord,
     Master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,
       And of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;
     A thing of much less import in that clime—
       At least to those of incomes which afford
     The filling up their whole connubial cargo—
     Than where two wives are under an embargo.
     He did not think much on the matter, nor
       Indeed on any other: as a man
     He liked to have a handsome paramour
       At hand, as one may like to have a fan,
     And therefore of Circassians had good store,
       As an amusement after the Divan;
     Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,
     Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.
     And now he rose; and after due ablutions
       Exacted by the customs of the East,
     And prayers and other pious evolutions,
       He drank six cups of coffee at the least,
     And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,
       Whose victories had recently increased
     In Catherine's reign, whom glory still adores,
     But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!
       Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend
     Thine ear, if it should reach—and now rhymes wander
       Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend
     A dreadful impulse to each loud meander
       Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend
     Their roar even with the Baltic's—so you be
     Your father's son, 'tis quite enough for me.
     To call men love-begotten or proclaim
       Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,
     That hater of mankind, would be a shame,
       A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:
     But people's ancestors are history's game;
       And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on
     All generations, I should like to know
     What pedigree the best would have to show?
     Had Catherine and the sultan understood
       Their own true interests, which kings rarely know
     Until 'tis taught by lessons rather rude,
       There was a way to end their strife, although
     Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,
       Without the aid of prince or plenipo:
     She to dismiss her guards and he his haram,
     And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.
     But as it was, his Highness had to hold
       His daily council upon ways and means
     How to encounter with this martial scold,
       This modern Amazon and queen of queans;
     And the perplexity could not be told
       Of all the pillars of the state, which leans
     Sometimes a little heavy on the backs
     Of those who cannot lay on a new tax.
     Meantime Gulbeyaz, when her king was gone,
       Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place
     For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,
       And rich with all contrivances which grace
     Those gay recesses:—many a precious stone
       Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase
     Of porcelain held in the fetter'd flowers,
     Those captive soothers of a captive's hours.
     Mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,
       Vied with each other on this costly spot;
     And singing birds without were heard to warble;
       And the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot
     Varied each ray;—but all descriptions garble
       The true effect, and so we had better not
     Be too minute; an outline is the best,—
     A lively reader's fancy does the rest.
     And here she summon'd Baba, and required
       Don Juan at his hands, and information
     Of what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,
       And whether he had occupied their station;
     If matters had been managed as desired,
       And his disguise with due consideration
     Kept up; and above all, the where and how
     He had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know.
     Baba, with some embarrassment, replied
       To this long catechism of questions, ask'd
     More easily than answer'd,—that he had tried
       His best to obey in what he had been task'd;
     But there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,
       Which hesitation more betray'd than mask'd;
     He scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource
     To which embarrass'd people have recourse.
     Gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,
       Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;
     She liked quick answers in all conversations;
       And when she saw him stumbling like a steed
     In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;
       And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,
     Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,
     And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.
     When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew
       To bode him no great good, he deprecated
     Her anger, and beseech'd she 'd hear him through—
       He could not help the thing which he related:
     Then out it came at length, that to Dudu
       Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;
     But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on
     The holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.
     The chief dame of the Oda, upon whom
       The discipline of the whole haram bore,
     As soon as they re-enter'd their own room,
       For Baba's function stopt short at the door,
     Had settled all; nor could he then presume
       (The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,
     Without exciting such suspicion as
     Might make the matter still worse than it was.
     He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure
       Juan had not betray'd himself; in fact
     'Twas certain that his conduct had been pure,
       Because a foolish or imprudent act
     Would not alone have made him insecure,
       But ended in his being found out and sack'd,
     And thrown into the sea.—Thus Baba spoke
     Of all save Dudu's dream, which was no joke.
     This he discreetly kept in the background,
       And talk'd away—and might have talk'd till now,
     For any further answer that he found,
       So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:
     Her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,
       As if she had received a sudden blow,
     And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly
     O'er her fair front, like Morning's on a lily.
     Although she was not of the fainting sort,
       Baba thought she would faint, but there he err'd—
     It was but a convulsion, which though short
       Can never be described; we all have heard,
     And some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'
       When things beyond the common have occurr'd;—
     Gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony
     What she could ne'er express—then how should I?
     She stood a moment as a Pythones
       Stands on her tripod, agonised, and full
     Of inspiration gather'd from distress,
       When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull
     The heart asunder;—then, as more or lees
       Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,
     She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,
     And bow'd her throbbing head o'er trembling knees.
     Her face declined and was unseen; her hair
       Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,
     Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,
       Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,
     A low soft ottoman), and black despair
       Stirr'd up and down her bosom like a billow,
     Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check
     Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.
     Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping
       Conceal'd her features better than a veil;
     And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,
       White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:
     Would that I were a painter! to be grouping
       All that a poet drags into detail
     O that my words were colours! but their tints
     May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.
     Baba, who knew by experience when to talk
       And when to hold his tongue, now held it till
     This passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk
       Gulbeyaz' taciturn or speaking will.
     At length she rose up, and began to walk
       Slowly along the room, but silent still,
     And her brow clear'd, but not her troubled eye;
     The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.
     She stopp'd, and raised her head to speak—but paused,
       And then moved on again with rapid pace;
     Then slacken'd it, which is the march most caused
       By deep emotion:—you may sometimes trace
     A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed
       By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased
     By all the demons of all passions, show'd
     Their work even by the way in which he trode.
     Gulbeyaz stopp'd and beckon'd Baba:—'Slave!
       Bring the two slaves!' she said in a low tone,
     But one which Baba did not like to brave,
       And yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone
     To prove reluctant, and begg'd leave to crave
       (Though he well knew the meaning) to be shown
     What slaves her highness wish'd to indicate,
     For fear of any error, like the late.
     'The Georgian and her paramour,' replied
       The imperial bride—and added, 'Let the boat
     Be ready by the secret portal's side:
       You know the rest.' The words stuck in her throat,
     Despite her injured love and fiery pride;
       And of this Baba willingly took note,
     And begg'd by every hair of Mahomet's beard,
     She would revoke the order he had heard.
     'To hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,
       Sultana, think upon the consequence:
     It is not that I shall not all fulfil
       Your orders, even in their severest sense;
     But such precipitation may end ill,
       Even at your own imperative expense:
     I do not mean destruction and exposure,
     In case of any premature disclosure;
     'But your own feelings. Even should all the rest
       Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide
     Already many a once love-beaten breast
       Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide—
     You love this boyish, new, seraglio guest,
       And if this violent remedy be tried—
     Excuse my freedom, when I here assure you,
     That killing him is not the way to cure you.'
     'What dost thou know of love or feeling?—Wretch!
       Begone!' she cried, with kindling eyes—'and do
     My bidding!' Baba vanish'd, for to stretch
       His own remonstrance further he well knew
     Might end in acting as his own 'Jack Ketch;'
       And though he wish'd extremely to get through
     This awkward business without harm to others,
     He still preferr'd his own neck to another's.
     Away he went then upon his commission,
       Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase
     Against all women of whate'er condition,
       Especially sultanas and their ways;
     Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,
       Their never knowing their own mind two days,
     The trouble that they gave, their immorality,
     Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.
     And then he call'd his brethren to his aid,
       And sent one on a summons to the pair,
     That they must instantly be well array'd,
       And above all be comb'd even to a hair,
     And brought before the empress, who had made
       Inquiries after them with kindest care:
     At which Dudu look'd strange, and Juan silly;
     But go they must at once, and will I—nill I.
     And here I leave them at their preparation
       For the imperial presence, wherein whether
     Gulbeyaz show'd them both commiseration,
       Or got rid of the parties altogether,
     Like other angry ladies of her nation,—
       Are things the turning of a hair or feather
     May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate
     In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.
     I leave them for the present with good wishes,
       Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange
     Another part of history; for the dishes
       Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;
     And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,
       Although his situation now seems strange
     And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,
     The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.
Canto 7
CANTO THE SEVENTH.
     O Love! O Glory! what are ye who fly
       Around us ever, rarely to alight?
     There 's not a meteor in the polar sky
       Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.
     Chill, and chain'd to cold earth, we lift on high
       Our eyes in search of either lovely light;
     A thousand and a thousand colours they
     Assume, then leave us on our freezing way.
     And such as they are, such my present tale is,
       A non-descript and ever-varying rhyme,
     A versified Aurora Borealis,
       Which flashes o'er a waste and icy clime.
     When we know what all are, we must bewail us,
       But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime
     To laugh at all things—for I wish to know
     What, after all, are all things—but a show?
     They accuse me—Me—the present writer of
       The present poem—of—I know not what—
     A tendency to under-rate and scoff
       At human power and virtue, and all that;
     And this they say in language rather rough.
       Good God! I wonder what they would be at!
     I say no more than hath been said in Dante's
     Verse, and by Solomon and by Cervantes;
     By Swift, by Machiavel, by Rochefoucault,
       By Fenelon, by Luther, and by Plato;
     By Tillotson, and Wesley, and Rousseau,
       Who knew this life was not worth a potato.
     'T is not their fault, nor mine, if this be so—
       For my part, I pretend not to be Cato,
     Nor even Diogenes.—We live and die,
     But which is best, you know no more than I.
     Socrates said, our only knowledge was
       'To know that nothing could be known;' a pleasant
     Science enough, which levels to an ass
       Each man of wisdom, future, past, or present.
     Newton (that proverb of the mind), alas!
       Declared, with all his grand discoveries recent,
     That he himself felt only 'like a youth
     Picking up shells by the great ocean—Truth.'
     Ecclesiastes said, 'that all is vanity'-
       Most modern preachers say the same, or show it
     By their examples of true Christianity:
       In short, all know, or very soon may know it;
     And in this scene of all-confess'd inanity,
       By saint, by sage, by preacher, and by poet,
     Must I restrain me, through the fear of strife,
     From holding up the nothingness of life?
     Dogs, or men!—for I flatter you in saying
       That ye are dogs—your betters far—ye may
     Read, or read not, what I am now essaying
       To show ye what ye are in every way.
     As little as the moon stops for the baying
       Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray
     From out her skies—then howl your idle wrath!
     While she still silvers o'er your gloomy path.
     'Fierce loves and faithless wars'—I am not sure
       If this be the right reading—'t is no matter;
     The fact 's about the same, I am secure;
       I sing them both, and am about to batter
     A town which did a famous siege endure,
       And was beleaguer'd both by land and water
     By Souvaroff, or Anglice Suwarrow,
     Who loved blood as an alderman loves marrow.
     The fortress is call'd Ismail, and is placed
       Upon the Danube's left branch and left bank,
     With buildings in the Oriental taste,
       But still a fortress of the foremost rank,
     Or was at least, unless 't is since defaced,
       Which with your conquerors is a common prank:
     It stands some eighty versts from the high sea,
     And measures round of toises thousands three.
     Within the extent of this fortification
       A borough is comprised along the height
     Upon the left, which from its loftier station
       Commands the city, and upon its site
     A Greek had raised around this elevation
       A quantity of palisades upright,
     So placed as to impede the fire of those
     Who held the place, and to assist the foe's.
     This circumstance may serve to give a notion
       Of the high talents of this new Vauban:
     But the town ditch below was deep as ocean,
       The rampart higher than you 'd wish to hang:
     But then there was a great want of precaution
       (Prithee, excuse this engineering slang),
     Nor work advanced, nor cover'd way was there,
     To hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.'
     But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,
       And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;
     Two batteries, cap-a-pie, as our St. George,
       Case-mated one, and t' other 'a barbette,'
     Of Danube's bank took formidable charge;
       While two and twenty cannon duly set
     Rose over the town's right side, in bristling tier,
     Forty feet high, upon a cavalier.
     But from the river the town 's open quite,
       Because the Turks could never be persuaded
     A Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;
       And such their creed was, till they were invaded,
     When it grew rather late to set things right.
       But as the Danube could not well be waded,
     They look'd upon the Muscovite flotilla,
     And only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'
     The Russians now were ready to attack:
       But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!
     How shall I spell the name of each Cossacque
       Who were immortal, could one tell their story?
     Alas! what to their memory can lack?
       Achilles' self was not more grim and gory
     Than thousands of this new and polish'd nation,
     Whose names want nothing but—pronunciation.
     Still I 'll record a few, if but to increase
       Our euphony: there was Strongenoff, and Strokonoff,
     Meknop, Serge Lwow, Arsniew of modern Greece,
       And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,
     And others of twelve consonants apiece;
       And more might be found out, if I could poke enough
     Into gazettes; but Fame (capricious strumpet),
     It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,
     And cannot tune those discords of narration,
       Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;
     Yet there were several worth commemoration,
       As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;
     Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration
       Of Londonderry drawling against time,
     Ending in 'ischskin,' 'ousckin,' 'iffskchy,' 'ouski:
     Of whom we can insert but Rousamouski,
     Scherematoff and Chrematoff, Koklophti,
       Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,
     All proper men of weapons, as e'er scoff'd high
       Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:
     Little cared they for Mahomet or Mufti,
       Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin
     Out of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,
     And no more handy substitute been near.
     Then there were foreigners of much renown,
       Of various nations, and all volunteers;
     Not fighting for their country or its crown,
       But wishing to be one day brigadiers;
     Also to have the sacking of a town,—
       A pleasant thing to young men at their years.
     'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,
     Sixteen call'd Thomson, and nineteen named Smith.
     Jack Thomson and Bill Thomson; all the rest
       Had been call'd 'Jemmy,' after the great bard;
     I don't know whether they had arms or crest,
       But such a godfather 's as good a card.
     Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best
       Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,
     Was he, since so renown'd 'in country quarters
     At Halifax;' but now he served the Tartars.
     The rest were jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills;
       But when I 've added that the elder jack Smith
     Was born in Cumberland among the hills,
       And that his father was an honest blacksmith,
     I 've said all I know of a name that fills
       Three lines of the despatch in taking 'Schmacksmith,'
     A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein
     He fell, immortal in a bulletin.
     I wonder (although Mars no doubt 's a god
       Praise) if a man's name in a bulletin
     May make up for a bullet in his body?
       I hope this little question is no sin,
     Because, though I am but a simple noddy,
       I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in
     The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,
     Which many people pass for wits by quoting.
     Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:
       But I 'm too great a patriot to record
     Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;
       I 'd rather tell ten lies than say a word
     Of truth;—such truths are treason; they betray
       Their country; and as traitors are abhorr'd
     Who name the French in English, save to show
     How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.
     The Russians, having built two batteries on
       An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;
     The first was to bombard it, and knock down
       The public buildings and the private too,
     No matter what poor souls might be undone.
       The city's shape suggested this, 't is true;
     Form'd like an amphitheatre, each dwelling
     Presented a fine mark to throw a shell in.
     The second object was to profit by
       The moment of the general consternation,
     To attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh
       Extremely tranquil, anchor'd at its station:
     But a third motive was as probably
       To frighten them into capitulation;
     A phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,
     Unless they are game as bull-dogs and fox-terriers.
     A habit rather blamable, which is
       That of despising those we combat with,
     Common in many cases, was in this
       The cause of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith;
     One of the valorous 'Smiths' whom we shall miss
       Out of those nineteen who late rhymed to 'pith;'
     But 't is a name so spread o'er 'Sir' and 'Madam,'
     That one would think the first who bore it 'Adam.'
     The Russian batteries were incomplete,
       Because they were constructed in a hurry;
     Thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,
       And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,
     When the sale of new books is not so fleet
       As they who print them think is necessary,
     May likewise put off for a time what story
     Sometimes calls 'murder,' and at others 'glory.'
     Whether it was their engineer's stupidity,
       Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,
     Or some contractor's personal cupidity,
       Saving his soul by cheating in the ware
     Of homicide, but there was no solidity
       In the new batteries erected there;
     They either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,
     And added greatly to the missing list.
     A sad miscalculation about distance
       Made all their naval matters incorrect;
     Three fireships lost their amiable existence
       Before they reach'd a spot to take effect:
     The match was lit too soon, and no assistance
       Could remedy this lubberly defect;
     They blew up in the middle of the river,
     While, though 't was dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.
     At seven they rose, however, and survey'd
       The Russ flotilla getting under way;
     'T was nine, when still advancing undismay'd,
       Within a cable's length their vessels lay
     Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,
       Which was return'd with interest, I may say,
     And by a fire of musketry and grape,
     And shells and shot of every size and shape.
     For six hours bore they without intermission
       The Turkish fire, and aided by their own
     Land batteries, work'd their guns with great precision:
       At length they found mere cannonade alone
     By no means would produce the town's submission,
       And made a signal to retreat at one.
     One bark blew up, a second near the works
     Running aground, was taken by the Turks.
     The Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;
       But when they saw the enemy retire,
     Their Delhis mann'd some boats, and sail'd again,
       And gall'd the Russians with a heavy fire,
     And tried to make a landing on the main;
       But here the effect fell short of their desire:
     Count Damas drove them back into the water
     Pell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.
     'If' (says the historian here) 'I could report
       All that the Russians did upon this day,
     I think that several volumes would fall short,
       And I should still have many things to say;'
     And so he says no more—but pays his court
       To some distinguish'd strangers in that fray;
     The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,
     Names great as any that the roll of Fame has.
     This being the case, may show us what Fame is:
       For out of these three 'preux Chevaliers,' how
     Many of common readers give a guess
       That such existed? (and they may live now
     For aught we know.) Renown 's all hit or miss;
       There 's fortune even in fame, we must allow.
     'T is true the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne
     Have half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.
     But here are men who fought in gallant actions
       As gallantly as ever heroes fought,
     But buried in the heap of such transactions
       Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.
     Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,
       And is extinguish'd sooner than she ought:
     Of all our modern battles, I will bet
     You can't repeat nine names from each Gazette.
     In short, this last attack, though rich in glory,
       Show'd that somewhere, somehow, there was a fault,
     And Admiral Ribas (known in Russian story)
       Most strongly recommended an assault;
     In which he was opposed by young and hoary,
       Which made a long debate; but I must halt,
     For if I wrote down every warrior's speech,
     I doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.
     There was a man, if that he was a man,
       Not that his manhood could be call'd in question,
     For had he not been Hercules, his span
       Had been as short in youth as indigestion
     Made his last illness, when, all worn and wan,
       He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on
     The soil of the green province he had wasted,
     As e'er was locust on the land it blasted.
     This was Potemkin—a great thing in days
       When homicide and harlotry made great;
     If stars and titles could entail long praise,
       His glory might half equal his estate.
     This fellow, being six foot high, could raise
       A kind of phantasy proportionate
     In the then sovereign of the Russian people,
     Who measured men as you would do a steeple.
     While things were in abeyance, Ribas sent
       A courier to the prince, and he succeeded
     In ordering matters after his own bent;
       I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,
     But shortly he had cause to be content.
       In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,
     And fourscore cannon on the Danube's border
     Were briskly fired and answer'd in due order.
     But on the thirteenth, when already part
       Of the troops were embark'd, the siege to raise,
     A courier on the spur inspired new heart
       Into all panters for newspaper praise,
     As well as dilettanti in war's art,
       By his despatches couch'd in pithy phrase;
     Announcing the appointment of that lover of
     Battles to the command, Field-Marshal Souvaroff.
     The letter of the prince to the same marshal
       Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause
     Been one to which a good heart could be partial—
       Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;
     But as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all
       With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,
     Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,
     'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'
     'Let there be light! said God, and there was light!'
       'Let there be blood!' says man, and there 's a seal
     The fiat of this spoil'd child of the Night
       (For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree
     More evil in an hour, than thirty bright
       Summers could renovate, though they should be
     Lovely as those which ripen'd Eden's fruit;
     For war cuts up not only branch, but root.
     Our friends the Turks, who with loud 'Allahs' now
       Began to signalise the Russ retreat,
     Were damnably mistaken; few are slow
       In thinking that their enemy is beat
     (Or beaten, if you insist on grammar, though
       I never think about it in a heat),
     But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,
     Who hating hogs, yet wish'd to save their bacon.
     For, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew
       In sight two horsemen, who were deem'd Cossacques
     For some time, till they came in nearer view.
       They had but little baggage at their backs,
     For there were but three shirts between the two;
       But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,
     Till, in approaching, were at length descried
     In this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.
     'Great joy to London now!' says some great fool,
       When London had a grand illumination,
     Which to that bottle-conjurer, John Bull,
       Is of all dreams the first hallucination;
     So that the streets of colour'd lamps are full,
       That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion
     His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,
     To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.
     'T is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'
       For they are damn'd; that once all-famous oath
     Is to the devil now no farther prize,
       Since John has lately lost the use of both.
     Debt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;
       And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,
     Which stare him in the face, he won't examine,
     Or swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.
     But to the tale:—great joy unto the camp!
       To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,
     O'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,
       Presaging a most luminous attack;
     Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,
       Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,
     He flitted to and fro a dancing light,
     Which all who saw it follow'd, wrong or right.
     But certes matters took a different face;
       There was enthusiasm and much applause,
     The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,
       And all presaged good fortune to their cause.
     Within a cannon-shot length of the place
       They drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws
     In former works, made new, prepared fascines,
     And all kinds of benevolent machines.
     'T is thus the spirit of a single mind
       Makes that of multitudes take one direction,
     As roll the waters to the breathing wind,
       Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;
     Or as a little dog will lead the blind,
       Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection
     By tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;
     Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.
     The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought
       That they were going to a marriage feast
     (This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,
       Since there is discord after both at least):
     There was not now a luggage boy but sought
       Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;
     And why? because a little—odd—old man,
     Stript to his shirt, was come to lead the van.
     But so it was; and every preparation
       Was made with all alacrity: the first
     Detachment of three columns took its station,
       And waited but the signal's voice to burst
     Upon the foe: the second's ordination
       Was also in three columns, with a thirst
     For glory gaping o'er a sea of slaughter:
     The third, in columns two, attack'd by water.
     New batteries were erected, and was held
       A general council, in which unanimity,
     That stranger to most councils, here prevail'd,
       As sometimes happens in a great extremity;
     And every difficulty being dispell'd,
       Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,
     While Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,
     Was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet
     It is an actual fact, that he, commander
       In chief, in proper person deign'd to drill
     The awkward squad, and could afford to squander
       His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:
     Just as you 'd break a sucking salamander
       To swallow flame, and never take it ill:
     He show'd them how to mount a ladder (which
     Was not like Jacob's) or to cross a ditch.
     Also he dress'd up, for the nonce, fascines
       Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,
     And made them charge with bayonet these machines,
       By way of lesson against actual Turks:
     And when well practised in these mimic scenes,
       He judged them proper to assail the works;
     At which your wise men sneer'd in phrases witty:
     He made no answer; but he took the city.
     Most things were in this posture on the eve
       Of the assault, and all the camp was in
     A stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;
       Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin
     Are very silent when they once believe
       That all is settled:—there was little din,
     For some were thinking of their home and friends,
     And others of themselves and latter ends.
     Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,
       Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;
     For the man was, we safely may assert,
       A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;
     Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,
       Praying, instructing, desolating, plundering;
     Now Mars, now Momus; and when bent to storm
     A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.
     The day before the assault, while upon drill—
       For this great conqueror play'd the corporal—
     Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,
       Had met a party towards the twilight's fall,
     One of whom spoke their tongue—or well or ill,
       'T was much that he was understood at all;
     But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,
     They found that he had fought beneath their banner.
     Whereon immediately at his request
       They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;
     Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd
       That these were merely masquerading Tartars,
     And that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest
       Lurk'd Christianity; which sometimes barters
     Her inward grace for outward show, and makes
     It difficult to shun some strange mistakes.
     Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt
       Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,
     Exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,
       And lecturing on the noble art of killing,—
     For deeming human clay but common dirt,
       This great philosopher was thus instilling
     His maxims, which to martial comprehension
     Proved death in battle equal to a pension;—
     Suwarrow, when he saw this company
       Of Cossacques and their prey, turn'd round and cast
     Upon them his slow brow and piercing eye:—
       'Whence come ye?'—'From Constantinople last,
     Captives just now escaped,' was the reply.
       'What are ye?'—'What you see us.' Briefly pass'd
     This dialogue; for he who answer'd knew
     To whom he spoke, and made his words but few.
     'Your names?'—'Mine 's Johnson, and my comrade 's Juan;
       The other two are women, and the third
     Is neither man nor woman.' The chief threw on
       The party a slight glance, then said, 'I have heard
     Your name before, the second is a new one:
       To bring the other three here was absurd:
     But let that pass:—I think I have heard your name
     In the Nikolaiew regiment?'—'The same.'
     'You served at Widdin?'—'Yes.'—'You led the attack?'
       'I did.'—'What next?'—'I really hardly know.'
     'You were the first i' the breach?'—'I was not slack
       At least to follow those who might be so.'
     'What follow'd?'—'A shot laid me on my back,
       And I became a prisoner to the foe.'
     'You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded
     Is twice as strong as that where you were wounded.
     'Where will you serve?'—'Where'er you please.'—'I know
       You like to be the hope of the forlorn,
     And doubtless would be foremost on the foe
       After the hardships you 've already borne.
     And this young fellow—say what can he do?
       He with the beardless chin and garments torn?'
     'Why, general, if he hath no greater fault
     In war than love, he had better lead the assault.'
     'He shall if that he dare.' Here Juan bow'd
       Low as the compliment deserved. Suwarrow
     Continued: 'Your old regiment's allow'd,
       By special providence, to lead to-morrow,
     Or it may be to-night, the assault: I have vow'd
       To several saints, that shortly plough or harrow
     Shall pass o'er what was Ismail, and its tusk
     Be unimpeded by the proudest mosque.
     'So now, my lads, for glory!'—Here he turn'd
       And drill'd away in the most classic Russian,
     Until each high, heroic bosom burn'd
       For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion
     A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn'd
       All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on
     To slay the Pagans who resisted, battering
     The armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.
     Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy
       Himself a favourite, ventured to address
     Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high
       In his resumed amusement. 'I confess
     My debt in being thus allow'd to die
       Among the foremost; but if you 'd express
     Explicitly our several posts, my friend
     And self would know what duty to attend.'
     'Right! I was busy, and forgot. Why, you
       Will join your former regiment, which should be
     Now under arms. Ho! Katskoff, take him to
       (Here he call'd up a Polish orderly)
     His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:
       The stranger stripling may remain with me;
     He 's a fine boy. The women may be sent
     To the other baggage, or to the sick tent.'
     But here a sort of scene began to ensue:
       The ladies,—who by no means had been bred
     To be disposed of in a way so new,
       Although their haram education led
     Doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,
       Passive obedience,—now raised up the head,
     With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung
     Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,
     O'er the promoted couple of brave men
       Who were thus honour'd by the greatest chief
     That ever peopled hell with heroes slain,
       Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.
     O, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!
       O, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf
     Of thine imaginary deathless tree,
     Of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.
     Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,
       And not much sympathy for blood, survey'd
     The women with their hair about their ears
       And natural agonies, with a slight shade
     Of feeling: for however habit sears
       Men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade
     Is butchery, sometimes a single sorrow
     Will touch even heroes—and such was Suwarrow.
     He said,—and in the kindest Calmuck tone,—
       'Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean
     By bringing women here? They shall be shown
       All the attention possible, and seen
     In safety to the waggons, where alone
       In fact they can be safe. You should have been
     Aware this kind of baggage never thrives:
     Save wed a year, I hate recruits with wives.'
     'May it please your excellency,' thus replied
       Our British friend, 'these are the wives of others,
     And not our own. I am too qualified
       By service with my military brothers
     To break the rules by bringing one's own bride
       Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers
     The hearts of the heroic on a charge,
     As leaving a small family at large.
     'But these are but two Turkish ladies, who
       With their attendant aided our escape,
     And afterwards accompanied us through
       A thousand perils in this dubious shape.
     To me this kind of life is not so new;
       To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape.
     I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,
     Request that they may both be used genteelly.'
     Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,
       Look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust
     Their own protectors; nor was their surprise
       Less than their grief (and truly not less just)
     To see an old man, rather wild than wise
       In aspect, plainly clad, besmear'd with dust,
     Stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,
     More fear'd than all the sultans ever seen.
     For every thing seem'd resting on his nod,
       As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,
     Who were accustom'd, as a sort of god,
       To see the sultan, rich in many a gem,
     Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad
       (That royal bird, whose tail 's a diadem),
     With all the pomp of power, it was a doubt
     How power could condescend to do without.
     John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,
       Though little versed in feelings oriental,
     Suggested some slight comfort in his way:
       Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,
     Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,
       Or that the Russian army should repent all:
     And, strange to say, they found some consolation
     In this—for females like exaggeration.
     And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,
       They parted for the present—these to await,
     According to the artillery's hits or misses,
       What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate
     (Uncertainty is one of many blisses,
       A mortgage on Humanity's estate)—
     While their beloved friends began to arm,
     To burn a town which never did them harm.
     Suwarrow,—who but saw things in the gross,
       Being much too gross to see them in detail,
     Who calculated life as so much dross,
       And as the wind a widow'd nation's wail,
     And cared as little for his army's loss
       (So that their efforts should at length prevail)
     As wife and friends did for the boils of job,—
     What was 't to him to hear two women sob?
     Nothing.—The work of glory still went on
       In preparations for a cannonade
     As terrible as that of Ilion,
       If Homer had found mortars ready made;
     But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,
       We only can but talk of escalade,
     Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,—
     Hard words, which stick in the soft Muses' gullets.
     O, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm
       All cars, though long; all ages, though so short,
     By merely wielding with poetic arm
       Arms to which men will never more resort,
     Unless gunpowder should be found to harm
       Much less than is the hope of every court,
     Which now is leagued young Freedom to annoy;
     But they will not find Liberty a Troy:—
     O, thou eternal Homer! I have now
       To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,
     With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,
       Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;
     And yet, like all men else, I must allow,
       To vie with thee would be about as vain
     As for a brook to cope with ocean's flood;
     But still we moderns equal you in blood;
     If not in poetry, at least in fact;
       And fact is truth, the grand desideratum!
     Of which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,
       There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.
     But now the town is going to be attack'd;
       Great deeds are doing—how shall I relate 'em?
     Souls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches
     To colour up his rays from your despatches.
     O, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!
       O, ye less grand long lists of kill'd and wounded!
     Shade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,
       When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!
     O, Caesar's Commentaries! now impart, ye
       Shadows of glory! (lest I be confounded)
     A portion of your fading twilight hues,
     So beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.
     When I call 'fading' martial immortality,
       I mean, that every age and every year,
     And almost every day, in sad reality,
       Some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,
     Who, when we come to sum up the totality
       Of deeds to human happiness most dear,
     Turns out to be a butcher in great business,
     Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.
     Medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,
       Are things immortal to immortal man,
     As purple to the Babylonian harlot:
       An uniform to boys is like a fan
     To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet
       But deems himself the first in Glory's van.
     But Glory's glory; and if you would find
     What that is—ask the pig who sees the wind!
     At least he feels it, and some say he sees,
       Because he runs before it like a pig;
     Or, if that simple sentence should displease,
       Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,
     A schooner, or—but it is time to ease
       This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.
     The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,
     Like a bob-major from a village steeple.
     Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,
       The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!
     Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight
       Along the leaguer'd wall and bristling bank
     Of the arm'd river, while with straggling light
       The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,
     Which curl in curious wreaths:—how soon the smoke
     Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!
     Here pause we for the present—as even then
       That awful pause, dividing life from death,
     Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,
       Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!
     A moment—and all will be life again!
       The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith!
     Hurra! and Allah! and—one moment more,
     The death-cry drowning in the battle's roar.
Canto 8
CANTO THE EIGHTH.
     O blood and thunder! and oh blood and wounds!
       These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,
     Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:
       And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream
     Unriddled, and as my true Muse expounds
       At present such things, since they are her theme,
     So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,
     Bellona, what you will—they mean but wars.
     All was prepared—the fire, the sword, the men
       To wield them in their terrible array.
     The army, like a lion from his den,
       March'd forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,—
     A human Hydra, issuing from its fen
       To breathe destruction on its winding way,
     Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain
     Immediately in others grew again.
     History can only take things in the gross;
       But could we know them in detail, perchance
     In balancing the profit and the loss,
       War's merit it by no means might enhance,
     To waste so much gold for a little dross,
       As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.
     The drying up a single tear has more
     Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.
     And why?—because it brings self-approbation;
       Whereas the other, after all its glare,
     Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,
       Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,
     A higher title, or a loftier station,
       Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,
     Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,
     Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.
     And such they are—and such they will be found:
       Not so Leonidas and Washington,
     Whose every battle-field is holy ground,
       Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.
     How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!
       While the mere victor's may appal or stun
     The servile and the vain, such names will be
     A watchword till the future shall be free.
     The night was dark, and the thick mist allow'd
       Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,
     Which arch'd the horizon like a fiery cloud,
       And in the Danube's waters shone the same—
     A mirror'd hell! the volleying roar, and loud
       Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame
     The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes
     Spare, or smite rarely—man's make millions ashes!
     The column order'd on the assault scarce pass'd
       Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,
     When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,
       Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:
     Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,
       Which rock'd as 't were beneath the mighty noises;
     While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when
     The restless Titan hiccups in his den.
     And one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose
       In the same moment, loud as even the roar
     Of war's most mortal engines, to their foes
       Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore
     Resounded 'Allah!' and the clouds which close
       With thick'ning canopy the conflict o'er,
     Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through
     All sounds it pierceth 'Allah! Allah! Hu!'
     The columns were in movement one and all,
       But of the portion which attack'd by water,
     Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,
       Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,
     As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.
       'Carnage' (so Wordsworth tells you) 'is God's daughter:'
     If he speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and
     Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.
     The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;
       Count Chapeau-Bras, too, had a ball between
     His cap and head, which proves the head to be
       Aristocratic as was ever seen,
     Because it then received no injury
       More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean
     No harm unto a right legitimate head:
     'Ashes to ashes'—why not lead to lead?
     Also the General Markow, Brigadier,
       Insisting on removal of the prince
     Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,—
       All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,
     And shriek for water into a deaf ear,—
       The General Markow, who could thus evince
     His sympathy for rank, by the same token,
     To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.
     Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,
       And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills
     Like hail, to make a bloody diuretic.
       Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills;
     Thy plagues, thy famines, thy physicians, yet tick,
       Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills
     Past, present, and to come;—but all may yield
     To the true portrait of one battle-field.
     There the still varying pangs, which multiply
       Until their very number makes men hard
     By the infinities of agony,
       Which meet the gaze whate'er it may regard—
     The groan, the roll in dust, the all-white eye
       Turn'd back within its socket,—these reward
     Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest
     May win perhaps a riband at the breast!
     Yet I love glory;—glory 's a great thing:—
       Think what it is to be in your old age
     Maintain'd at the expense of your good king:
       A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,
     And heroes are but made for bards to sing,
       Which is still better; thus in verse to wage
     Your wars eternally, besides enjoying
     Half-pay for life, make mankind worth destroying.
     The troops, already disembark'd, push'd on
       To take a battery on the right; the others,
     Who landed lower down, their landing done,
       Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:
     Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,
       Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,
     O'er the entrenchment and the palisade,
     Quite orderly, as if upon parade.
     And this was admirable; for so hot
       The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,
     Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot
       And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.
     Of officers a third fell on the spot,
       A thing which victory by no means boded
     To gentlemen engaged in the assault:
     Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.
     But here I leave the general concern,
       To track our hero on his path of fame:
     He must his laurels separately earn;
       For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,
     Though all deserving equally to turn
       A couplet, or an elegy to claim,
     Would form a lengthy lexicon of glory,
     And what is worse still, a much longer story:
     And therefore we must give the greater number
       To the Gazette—which doubtless fairly dealt
     By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber
       In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt
     Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;—
       Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt
     In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss
     Was printed Grove, although his name was Grose.
     Juan and Johnson join'd a certain corps,
       And fought away with might and main, not knowing
     The way which they had never trod before,
       And still less guessing where they might be going;
     But on they march'd, dead bodies trampling o'er,
       Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,
     But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,
     To their two selves, one whole bright bulletin.
     Thus on they wallow'd in the bloody mire
       Of dead and dying thousands,—sometimes gaining
     A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher
       To some odd angle for which all were straining;
     At other times, repulsed by the close fire,
       Which really pour'd as if all hell were raining
     Instead of heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er
     A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.
     Though 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though
       The nightly muster and the silent march
     In the chill dark, when courage does not glow
       So much as under a triumphal arch,
     Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw
       A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,
     Which stiffen'd heaven) as if he wish'd for day;—
     Yet for all this he did not run away.
     Indeed he could not. But what if he had?
       There have been and are heroes who begun
     With something not much better, or as bad:
       Frederic the Great from Molwitz deign'd to run,
     For the first and last time; for, like a pad,
       Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one
     Warm bout are broken into their new tricks,
     And fight like fiends for pay or politics.
     He was what Erin calls, in her sublime
       Old Erse or Irish, or it may be Punic
     (The antiquarians who can settle time,
       Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic,
     Swear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime
       With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic
     Of Dido's alphabet; and this is rational
     As any other notion, and not national);—
     But Juan was quite 'a broth of a boy,'
       A thing of impulse and a child of song;
     Now swimming in the sentiment of joy,
       Or the sensation (if that phrase seem wrong),
     And afterward, if he must needs destroy,
       In such good company as always throng
     To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,
     No less delighted to employ his leisure;
     But always without malice: if he warr'd
       Or loved, it was with what we call 'the best
     Intentions,' which form all mankind's trump card,
       To be produced when brought up to the test.
     The statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer—ward
       Off each attack, when people are in quest
     Of their designs, by saying they meant well;
     'T is pity 'that such meaning should pave hell.'
     I almost lately have begun to doubt
       Whether hell's pavement—if it be so paved—
     Must not have latterly been quite worn out,
       Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,
     But by the mass who go below without
       Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved
     And smooth'd the brimstone of that street of hell
     Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.
     Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides
       Warrior from warrior in their grim career,
     Like chastest wives from constant husbands' sides
       Just at the close of the first bridal year,
     By one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,
       Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,
     When, after a good deal of heavy firing,
     He found himself alone, and friends retiring.
     I don't know how the thing occurr'd—it might
       Be that the greater part were kill'd or wounded,
     And that the rest had faced unto the right
       About; a circumstance which has confounded
     Caesar himself, who, in the very sight
       Of his whole army, which so much abounded
     In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,
     And rally back his Romans to the field.
     Juan, who had no shield to snatch, and was
       No Caesar, but a fine young lad, who fought
     He knew not why, arriving at this pass,
       Stopp'd for a minute, as perhaps he ought
     For a much longer time; then, like an as
       (Start not, kind reader; since great Homer thought
     This simile enough for Ajax, Juan
     Perhaps may find it better than a new one)—
     Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,
       And, what was stranger, never look'd behind;
     But seeing, flashing forward, like the day
       Over the hills, a fire enough to blind
     Those who dislike to look upon a fray,
       He stumbled on, to try if he could find
     A path, to add his own slight arm and forces
     To corps, the greater part of which were corses.
     Perceiving then no more the commandant
       Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had
     Quite disappear'd—the gods know howl (I can't
       Account for every thing which may look bad
     In history; but we at least may grant
       It was not marvellous that a mere lad,
     In search of glory, should look on before,
     Nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps):—
     Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,
       And left at large, like a young heir, to make
     His way to—where he knew not—single handed;
       As travellers follow over bog and brake
     An 'ignis fatuus;' or as sailors stranded
       Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;
     So Juan, following honour and his nose,
     Rush'd where the thickest fire announced most foes.
     He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,
       For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins
     Fill'd as with lightning—for his spirit shared
       The hour, as is the case with lively brains;
     And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,
       And the loud cannon peal'd his hoarsest strains,
     He rush'd, while earth and air were sadly shaken
     By thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon!
     And as he rush'd along, it came to pass he
       Fell in with what was late the second column,
     Under the orders of the General Lascy,
       But now reduced, as is a bulky volume
     Into an elegant extract (much less massy)
       Of heroism, and took his place with solemn
     Air 'midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces
     And levell'd weapons still against the glacis.
     Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,
       Who had 'retreated,' as the phrase is when
     Men run away much rather than go through
       Destruction's jaws into the devil's den;
     But Johnson was a clever fellow, who
       Knew when and how 'to cut and come again,'
     And never ran away, except when running
     Was nothing but a valorous kind of cunning.
     And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,
       Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose
     More virgin valour never dreamt of flying
       From ignorance of danger, which indues
     Its votaries, like innocence relying
       On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,—
     Johnson retired a little, just to rally
     Those who catch cold in 'shadows of Death's valley.'
     And there, a little shelter'd from the shot,
       Which rain'd from bastion, battery, parapet,
     Rampart, wall, casement, house,—for there was not
       In this extensive city, sore beset
     By Christian soldiery, a single spot
       Which did not combat like the devil, as yet,
     He found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter'd
     By the resistance of the chase they batter'd.
     And these he call'd on; and, what 's strange, they came
       Unto his call, unlike 'the spirits from
     The vasty deep,' to whom you may exclaim,
       Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home.
     Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame
       At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,
     And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds
     Makes men, like cattle, follow him who leads.
     By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,
       And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,
     Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon
       We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his
     Man quite as quietly as blows the monsoon
       Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):
     Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,
     And could be very busy without bustle;
     And therefore, when he ran away, he did so
       Upon reflection, knowing that behind
     He would find others who would fain be rid so
       Of idle apprehensions, which like wind
     Trouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so
       Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,
     But when they light upon immediate death,
     Retire a little, merely to take breath.
     But Johnson only ran off, to return
       With many other warriors, as we said,
     Unto that rather somewhat misty bourn,
       Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.
     To Jack howe'er this gave but slight concern:
       His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)
     Acted upon the living as on wire,
     And led them back into the heaviest fire.
     Egad! they found the second time what they
       The first time thought quite terrible enough
     To fly from, malgre all which people say
       Of glory, and all that immortal stuff
     Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,
       That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)—
     They found on their return the self-same welcome,
     Which made some think, and others know, a hell come.
     They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,
       Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,
     Proving that trite old truth, that life 's as frail
       As any other boon for which men stickle.
     The Turkish batteries thrash'd them like a flail,
       Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle
     Putting the very bravest, who were knock'd
     Upon the head, before their guns were cock'd.
     The Turks, behind the traverses and flanks
       Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,
     And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:
       However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels
     Towns, nations, worlds, in her revolving pranks,
       So order'd it, amidst these sulphury revels,
     That Johnson and some few who had not scamper'd,
     Reach'd the interior talus of the rampart.
     First one or two, then five, six, and a dozen,
       Came mounting quickly up, for it was now
     All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,
       Flame was shower'd forth above, as well 's below,
     So that you scarce could say who best had chosen,
       The gentlemen that were the first to show
     Their martial faces on the parapet,
     Or those who thought it brave to wait as yet.
     But those who scaled, found out that their advance
       Was favour'd by an accident or blunder:
     The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance
       Had palisado'd in a way you 'd wonder
     To see in forts of Netherlands or France
       (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)—
     Right in the middle of the parapet
     Just named, these palisades were primly set:
     So that on either side some nine or ten
       Paces were left, whereon you could contrive
     To march; a great convenience to our men,
       At least to all those who were left alive,
     Who thus could form a line and fight again;
       And that which farther aided them to strive
     Was, that they could kick down the palisades,
     Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.
     Among the first,—I will not say the first,
       For such precedence upon such occasions
     Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst
       Out between friends as well as allied nations:
     The Briton must be bold who really durst
       Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,
     As say that Wellington at Waterloo
     Was beaten—though the Prussians say so too;—
     And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,
       And God knows who besides in 'au' and 'ow,'
     Had not come up in time to cast an awe
       Into the hearts of those who fought till now
     As tigers combat with an empty craw,
       The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show
     His orders, also to receive his pensions,
     Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.
     But never mind;—'God save the king!' and kings!
       For if he don't, I doubt if men will longer—
     I think I hear a little bird, who sings
       The people by and by will be the stronger:
     The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings
       So much into the raw as quite to wrong her
     Beyond the rules of posting,—and the mob
     At last fall sick of imitating Job.
     At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,
       Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a giant;
     At last it takes to weapons such as men
       Snatch when despair makes human hearts less pliant.
     Then comes 'the tug of war;'—'t will come again,
       I rather doubt; and I would fain say 'fie on 't,'
     If I had not perceived that revolution
     Alone can save the earth from hell's pollution.
     But to continue:—I say not the first,
       But of the first, our little friend Don Juan
     Walk'd o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed
       Amidst such scenes—though this was quite a new one
     To him, and I should hope to most. The thirst
       Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,
     Pervaded him—although a generous creature,
     As warm in heart as feminine in feature.
     And here he was—who upon woman's breast,
       Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er
     The man in all the rest might be confest,
       To him it was Elysium to be there;
     And he could even withstand that awkward test
       Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,
     'Observe your lover when he leaves your arms;'
     But Juan never left them, while they had charms,
     Unless compell'd by fate, or wave, or wind,
       Or near relations, who are much the same.
     But here he was!—where each tie that can bind
       Humanity must yield to steel and flame:
     And he whose very body was all mind,
       Flung here by fate or circumstance, which tame
     The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,
     Dash'd on like a spurr'd blood-horse in a race.
     So was his blood stirr'd while he found resistance,
       As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,
     Or double post and rail, where the existence
       Of Britain's youth depends upon their weight,
     The lightest being the safest: at a distance
       He hated cruelty, as all men hate
     Blood, until heated—and even then his own
     At times would curdle o'er some heavy groan.
     The General Lascy, who had been hard press'd,
       Seeing arrive an aid so opportune
     As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,
       Who came as if just dropp'd down from the moon,
     To Juan, who was nearest him, address'd
       His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,
     Not reckoning him to be a 'base Bezonian'
     (As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.
     Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew
       As much of German as of Sanscrit, and
     In answer made an inclination to
       The general who held him in command;
     For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,
       Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,
     Addressing him in tones which seem'd to thank,
     He recognised an officer of rank.
     Short speeches pass between two men who speak
       No common language; and besides, in time
     Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek
       Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime
     Is perpetrated ere a word can break
       Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime
     In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,
     There cannot be much conversation there.
     And therefore all we have related in
       Two long octaves, pass'd in a little minute;
     But in the same small minute, every sin
       Contrived to get itself comprised within it.
     The very cannon, deafen'd by the din,
       Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,
     As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise
     Of human nature's agonising voice!
     The town was enter'd. Oh eternity!-
       'God made the country and man made the town,'
     So Cowper says—and I begin to be
       Of his opinion, when I see cast down
     Rome, Babylon, Tyre, Carthage, Nineveh,
       All walls men know, and many never known;
     And pondering on the present and the past,
     To deem the woods shall be our home at last
     Of all men, saving Sylla the man-slayer,
       Who passes for in life and death most lucky,
     Of the great names which in our faces stare,
       The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,
     Was happiest amongst mortals anywhere;
       For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he
     Enjoy'd the lonely, vigorous, harmless days
     Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.
     Crime came not near him—she is not the child
       Of solitude; Health shrank not from him—for
     Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,
       Where if men seek her not, and death be more
     Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled
       By habit to what their own hearts abhor—
     In cities caged. The present case in point I
     Cite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;
     And what 's still stranger, left behind a name
       For which men vainly decimate the throng,
     Not only famous, but of that good fame,
       Without which glory 's but a tavern song—
     Simple, serene, the antipodes of shame,
       Which hate nor envy e'er could tinge with wrong;
     An active hermit, even in age the child
     Of Nature, or the man of Ross run wild.
     'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,
       When they built up unto his darling trees,—
     He moved some hundred miles off, for a station
       Where there were fewer houses and more ease;
     The inconvenience of civilisation
       Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;
     But where he met the individual man,
     He show'd himself as kind as mortal can.
     He was not all alone: around him grew
       A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,
     Whose young, unwaken'd world was ever new,
       Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace
     On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view
       A frown on Nature's or on human face;
     The free-born forest found and kept them free,
     And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.
     And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,
       Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,
     Because their thoughts had never been the prey
       Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;
     No sinking spirits told them they grew grey,
       No fashion made them apes of her distortions;
     Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,
     Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.
     Motion was in their days, rest in their slumbers,
       And cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;
     Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;
       Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;
     The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,
       With the free foresters divide no spoil;
     Serene, not sullen, were the solitudes
     Of this unsighing people of the woods.
     So much for Nature:—by way of variety,
       Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!
     And the sweet consequence of large society,
       War, pestilence, the despot's desolation,
     The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,
       The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,
     The scenes like Catherine's boudoir at threescore,
     With Ismail's storm to soften it the more.
     The town was enter'd: first one column made
       Its sanguinary way good—then another;
     The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade
       Clash'd 'gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother
     With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:
       Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother
     The breath of morn and man, where foot by foot
     The madden'd Turks their city still dispute.
     Koutousow, he who afterward beat back
       (With some assistance from the frost and snow)
     Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,
       It happen'd was himself beat back just now;
     He was a jolly fellow, and could crack
       His jest alike in face of friend or foe,
     Though life, and death, and victory were at stake;
     But here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:
     For having thrown himself into a ditch,
       Follow'd in haste by various grenadiers,
     Whose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,
       He climb'd to where the parapet appears;
     But there his project reach'd its utmost pitch
       ('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's
     Was much regretted), for the Moslem men
     Threw them all down into the ditch again.
     And had it not been for some stray troops landing
       They knew not where, being carried by the stream
     To some spot, where they lost their understanding,
       And wander'd up and down as in a dream,
     Until they reach'd, as daybreak was expanding,
       That which a portal to their eyes did seem,—
     The great and gay Koutousow might have lain
     Where three parts of his column yet remain.
     And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,
       After the taking of the 'Cavalier,'
     Just as Koutousow's most 'forlorn' of 'hopes'
       Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,
     Open'd the gate call'd 'Kilia,' to the groups
       Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,
     Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,
     Now thaw'd into a marsh of human blood.
     The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques
       (I don't much pique myself upon orthography,
     So that I do not grossly err in facts,
       Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)—
     Having been used to serve on horses' backs,
       And no great dilettanti in topography
     Of fortresses, but fighting where it pleases
     Their chiefs to order,—were all cut to pieces.
     Their column, though the Turkish batteries thunder'd
       Upon them, ne'ertheless had reach'd the rampart,
     And naturally thought they could have plunder'd
       The city, without being farther hamper'd;
     But as it happens to brave men, they blunder'd—
       The Turks at first pretended to have scamper'd,
     Only to draw them 'twixt two bastion corners,
     From whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.
     Then being taken by the tail—a taking
       Fatal to bishops as to soldiers—these
     Cossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,
       And found their lives were let at a short lease—
     But perish'd without shivering or shaking,
       Leaving as ladders their heap'd carcasses,
     O'er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi
     March'd with the brave battalion of Polouzki:—
     This valiant man kill'd all the Turks he met,
       But could not eat them, being in his turn
     Slain by some Mussulmans, who would not yet,
       Without resistance, see their city burn.
     The walls were won, but 't was an even bet
       Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:
     'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,
     For one would not retreat, nor t' other flinch.
     Another column also suffer'd much:—
       And here we may remark with the historian,
     You should but give few cartridges to such
       Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:
     When matters must be carried by the touch
       Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,
     They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,
     Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.
     A junction of the General Meknop's men
       (Without the General, who had fallen some time
     Before, being badly seconded just then)
       Was made at length with those who dared to climb
     The death-disgorging rampart once again;
       And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,
     They took the bastion, which the Seraskier
     Defended at a price extremely dear.
     Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,
       Among the foremost, offer'd him good quarter,
     A word which little suits with Seraskiers,
       Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.
     He died, deserving well his country's tears,
       A savage sort of military martyr.
     An English naval officer, who wish'd
     To make him prisoner, was also dish'd:
     For all the answer to his proposition
       Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;
     On which the rest, without more intermission,
       Began to lay about with steel and lead—
     The pious metals most in requisition
       On such occasions: not a single head
     Was spared;—three thousand Moslems perish'd here,
     And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.
     The city 's taken—only part by part—
       And death is drunk with gore: there 's not a street
     Where fights not to the last some desperate heart
       For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.
     Here War forgot his own destructive art
       In more destroying Nature; and the heat
     Of carnage, like the Nile's sun-sodden slime,
     Engender'd monstrous shapes of every crime.
     A Russian officer, in martial tread
       Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel
     Seized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head
       Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel:
     In vain he kick'd, and swore, and writhed, and bled,
       And howl'd for help as wolves do for a meal—
     The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,
     As do the subtle snakes described of old.
     A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot
       Of a foe o'er him, snatch'd at it, and bit
     The very tendon which is most acute
       (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit
     Named after thee, Achilles), and quite through 't
       He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it
     Even with his life—for (but they lie) 't is said
     To the live leg still clung the sever'd head.
     However this may be, 't is pretty sure
       The Russian officer for life was lamed,
     For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,
       And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:
     The regimental surgeon could not cure
       His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed
     More than the head of the inveterate foe,
     Which was cut off, and scarce even then let go.
     But then the fact 's a fact—and 't is the part
       Of a true poet to escape from fiction
     Whene'er he can; for there is little art
       In leaving verse more free from the restriction
     Of truth than prose, unless to suit the mart
       For what is sometimes called poetic diction,
     And that outrageous appetite for lies
     Which Satan angles with for souls, like flies.
     The city 's taken, but not render'd!—No!
       There 's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:
     The blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow
       Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word
     Acknowledge aught of dread of death or foe:
       In vain the yell of victory is roar'd
     By the advancing Muscovite—the groan
     Of the last foe is echoed by his own.
     The bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,
       And human lives are lavish'd everywhere,
     As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves
       When the stripp'd forest bows to the bleak air,
     And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,
       Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;
     But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,
     As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.
     It is an awful topic—but 't is not
       My cue for any time to be terrific:
     For checker'd as is seen our human lot
       With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific
     Of melancholy merriment, to quote
       Too much of one sort would be soporific;—
     Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,
     I sketch your world exactly as it goes.
     And one good action in the midst of crimes
       Is 'quite refreshing,' in the affected phrase
     Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,
       With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,
     And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,
       A little scorch'd at present with the blaze
     Of conquest and its consequences, which
     Make epic poesy so rare and rich.
     Upon a taken bastion, where there lay
       Thousands of slaughter'd men, a yet warm group
     Of murder'd women, who had found their way
       To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop
     And shudder;—while, as beautiful as May,
       A female child of ten years tried to stoop
     And hide her little palpitating breast
     Amidst the bodies lull'd in bloody rest.
     Two villainous Cossacques pursued the child
       With flashing eyes and weapons: match'd with them,
     The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild
       Has feelings pure and polish'd as a gem,—
     The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;
       And whom for this at last must we condemn?
     Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ
     All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?
     Their sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,
       Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,
     Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:
       When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,
     I shall not say exactly what he said,
       Because it might not solace 'ears polite;'
     But what he did, was to lay on their backs,
     The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.
     One's hip he slash'd, and split the other's shoulder,
       And drove them with their brutal yells to seek
     If there might be chirurgeons who could solder
       The wounds they richly merited, and shriek
     Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder
       As he turn'd o'er each pale and gory cheek,
     Don Juan raised his little captive from
     The heap a moment more had made her tomb.
     And she was chill as they, and on her face
       A slender streak of blood announced how near
     Her fate had been to that of all her race;
       For the same blow which laid her mother here
     Had scarr'd her brow, and left its crimson trace,
       As the last link with all she had held dear;
     But else unhurt, she open'd her large eyes,
     And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.
     Just at this instant, while their eyes were fix'd
       Upon each other, with dilated glance,
     In Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mix'd
       With joy to save, and dread of some mischance
     Unto his protege; while hers, transfix'd
       With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,
     A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,
     Like to a lighted alabaster vase;—
     Up came John Johnson (I will not say 'Jack,'
       For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace
     On great occasions, such as an attack
       On cities, as hath been the present case):
     Up Johnson came, with hundreds at his back,
       Exclaiming;—'Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace
     Your arm, and I 'll bet Moscow to a dollar
     That you and I will win St. George's collar.
     'The Seraskier is knock'd upon the head,
       But the stone bastion still remains, wherein
     The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,
       Smoking his pipe quite calmly 'midst the din
     Of our artillery and his own: 't is said
       Our kill'd, already piled up to the chin,
     Lie round the battery; but still it batters,
     And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.
     'Then up with me!'—But Juan answer'd, 'Look
       Upon this child—I saved her—must not leave
     Her life to chance; but point me out some nook
       Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,
     And I am with you.'—Whereon Johnson took
       A glance around—and shrugg'd—and twitch'd his sleeve
     And black silk neckcloth—and replied, 'You 're right;
     Poor thing! what 's to be done? I 'm puzzled quite.'
     Said Juan: 'Whatsoever is to be
       Done, I 'll not quit her till she seems secure
     Of present life a good deal more than we.'
       Quoth Johnson: 'Neither will I quite ensure;
     But at the least you may die gloriously.'
       Juan replied: 'At least I will endure
     Whate'er is to be borne—but not resign
     This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.'
     Johnson said: 'Juan, we 've no time to lose;
       The child 's a pretty child—a very pretty—
     I never saw such eyes—but hark! now choose
       Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;—
     Hark! how the roar increases!—no excuse
       Will serve when there is plunder in a city;—
     I should be loth to march without you, but,
     By God! we 'll be too late for the first cut.'
     But Juan was immovable; until
       Johnson, who really loved him in his way,
     Pick'd out amongst his followers with some skill
       Such as he thought the least given up to prey;
     And swearing if the infant came to ill
       That they should all be shot on the next day;
     But if she were deliver'd safe and sound,
     They should at least have fifty rubles round,
     And all allowances besides of plunder
       In fair proportion with their comrades;—then
     Juan consented to march on through thunder,
       Which thinn'd at every step their ranks of men:
     And yet the rest rush'd eagerly—no wonder,
       For they were heated by the hope of gain,
     A thing which happens everywhere each day—
     No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.
     And such is victory, and such is man!
       At least nine tenths of what we call so;—God
     May have another name for half we scan
       As human beings, or his ways are odd.
     But to our subject: a brave Tartar khan—
       Or 'sultan,' as the author (to whose nod
     In prose I bend my humble verse) doth call
     This chieftain—somehow would not yield at all:
     But flank'd by five brave sons (such is polygamy,
       That she spawns warriors by the score, where none
     Are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),
       He never would believe the city won
     While courage clung but to a single twig.—Am I
       Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?
     Neither—but a good, plain, old, temperate man,
     Who fought with his five children in the van.
     To take him was the point. The truly brave,
       When they behold the brave oppress'd with odds,
     Are touch'd with a desire to shield and save;—
       A mixture of wild beasts and demigods
     Are they—now furious as the sweeping wave,
       Now moved with pity: even as sometimes nods
     The rugged tree unto the summer wind,
     Compassion breathes along the savage mind.
     But he would not be taken, and replied
       To all the propositions of surrender
     By mowing Christians down on every side,
       As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.
     His five brave boys no less the foe defied;
       Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender,
     As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,
     Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.
     And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who
       Expended all their Eastern phraseology
     In begging him, for God's sake, just to show
       So much less fight as might form an apology
     For them in saving such a desperate foe—
       He hew'd away, like doctors of theology
     When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses
     Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.
     Nay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both
       Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,
     The first with sighs, the second with an oath,
       Upon his angry sultanship, pell-mell,
     And all around were grown exceeding wroth
       At such a pertinacious infidel,
     And pour'd upon him and his sons like rain,
     Which they resisted like a sandy plain
     That drinks and still is dry. At last they perish'd—
       His second son was levell'd by a shot;
     His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd
       Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;
     The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourish'd,
       Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,
     Because deform'd, yet died all game and bottom,
     To save a sire who blush'd that he begot him.
     The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,
       As great a scorner of the Nazarene
     As ever Mahomet pick'd out for a martyr,
       Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,
     Who make the beds of those who won't take quarter
       On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,
     Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,
     Do just whate'er they please, by dint of features.
     And what they pleased to do with the young khan
       In heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;
     But doubtless they prefer a fine young man
       To tough old heroes, and can do no less;
     And that 's the cause no doubt why, if we scan
       A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,
     For one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,
     You 'll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.
     Your houris also have a natural pleasure
       In lopping off your lately married men,
     Before the bridal hours have danced their measure
       And the sad, second moon grows dim again,
     Or dull repentance hath had dreary leisure
       To wish him back a bachelor now and then.
     And thus your houri (it may be) disputes
     Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.
     Thus the young khan, with houris in his sight,
       Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,
     But bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.
       In short, howe'er our better faith derides,
     These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,
       As though there were one heaven and none besides,—
     Whereas, if all be true we hear of heaven
     And hell, there must at least be six or seven.
     So fully flash'd the phantom on his eyes,
       That when the very lance was in his heart,
     He shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise
       With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,
     And bright eternity without disguise
       On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:—
     With prophets, houris, angels, saints, descried
     In one voluptuous blaze,—and then he died,
     But with a heavenly rapture on his face.
       The good old khan, who long had ceased to see
     Houris, or aught except his florid race
       Who grew like cedars round him gloriously—
     When he beheld his latest hero grace
       The earth, which he became like a fell'd tree,
     Paused for a moment, from the fight, and cast
     A glance on that slain son, his first and last.
     The soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,
       Stopp'd as if once more willing to concede
     Quarter, in case he bade them not 'aroynt!'
       As he before had done. He did not heed
     Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,
       And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,
     As he look'd down upon his children gone,
     And felt—though done with life—he was alone
     But 't was a transient tremor;—with a spring
       Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,
     As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing
       Against the light wherein she dies: he clung
     Closer, that all the deadlier they might wring,
       Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;
     And throwing back a dim look on his sons,
     In one wide wound pour'd forth his soul at once.
     'T is strange enough—the rough, tough soldiers, who
       Spared neither sex nor age in their career
     Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,
       And lay before them with his children near,
     Touch'd by the heroism of him they slew,
       Were melted for a moment: though no tear
     Flow'd from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,
     They honour'd such determined scorn of life.
     But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,
       Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:
     Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,
       And baffled the assaults of all their host;
     At length he condescended to inquire
       If yet the city's rest were won or lost;
     And being told the latter, sent a bey
     To answer Ribas' summons to give way.
     In the mean time, cross-legg'd, with great sang-froid,
       Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking
     Tobacco on a little carpet;—Troy
       Saw nothing like the scene around:—yet looking
     With martial stoicism, nought seem'd to annoy
       His stern philosophy; but gently stroking
     His beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,
     As if he had three lives, as well as tails.
     The town was taken—whether he might yield
       Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:
     His stubborn valour was no future shield.
       Ismail 's no more! The crescent's silver bow
     Sunk, and the crimson cross glared o'er the field,
       But red with no redeeming gore: the glow
     Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,
     Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.
     All that the mind would shrink from of excesses;
       All that the body perpetrates of bad;
     All that we read, hear, dream, of man's distresses;
       All that the devil would do if run stark mad;
     All that defies the worst which pen expresses;
       All by which hell is peopled, or as sad
     As hell—mere mortals who their power abuse—
     Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.
     If here and there some transient trait of pity
       Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through
     Its bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty
       Child, or an aged, helpless man or two—
     What 's this in one annihilated city,
       Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?
     Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!
     Just ponder what a pious pastime war is.
     Think how the joys of reading a Gazette
       Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:
     Or if these do not move you, don't forget
       Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.
     Meantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,
       Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.
     Read your own hearts and Ireland's present story,
     Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.
     But still there is unto a patriot nation,
       Which loves so well its country and its king,
     A subject of sublimest exultation—
       Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!
     Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,
       Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,
     Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne—
     Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.
     But let me put an end unto my theme:
       There was an end of Ismail—hapless town!
     Far flash'd her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,
       And redly ran his blushing waters down.
     The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream
       Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:
     Of forty thousand who had mann'd the wall,
     Some hundreds breathed—the rest were silent all!
     In one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise
       The Russian army upon this occasion,
     A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,
       And therefore worthy of commemoration:
     The topic 's tender, so shall be my phrase—
       Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station
     In winter's depth, or want of rest and victual,
     Had made them chaste;—they ravish'd very little.
     Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less
       Might here and there occur some violation
     In the other line;—but not to such excess
       As when the French, that dissipated nation,
     Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,
       Except cold weather and commiseration;
     But all the ladies, save some twenty score,
     Were almost as much virgins as before.
     Some odd mistakes, too, happen'd in the dark,
       Which show'd a want of lanterns, or of taste—
     Indeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark
       Their friends from foes,—besides such things from haste
     Occur, though rarely, when there is a spark
       Of light to save the venerably chaste:
     But six old damsels, each of seventy years,
     Were all deflower'd by different grenadiers.
     But on the whole their continence was great;
       So that some disappointment there ensued
     To those who had felt the inconvenient state
       Of 'single blessedness,' and thought it good
     (Since it was not their fault, but only fate,
       To bear these crosses) for each waning prude
     To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,
     Without the expense and the suspense of bedding.
     Some voices of the buxom middle-aged
       Were also heard to wonder in the din
     (Widows of forty were these birds long caged)
       'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'
     But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,
       There was small leisure for superfluous sin;
     But whether they escaped or no, lies hid
     In darkness—I can only hope they did.
     Suwarrow now was conqueror—a match
       For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.
     While mosques and streets, beneath his eyes, like thatch
       Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allay'd,
     With bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;
       And here exactly follows what he said:—
     'Glory to God and to the Empress!' (Powers
     Eternal! such names mingled!) 'Ismail 's ours.'
     Methinks these are the most tremendous words,
       Since 'Mene, Mene, Tekel,' and 'Upharsin,'
     Which hands or pens have ever traced of swords.
       Heaven help me! I 'm but little of a parson:
     What Daniel read was short-hand of the Lord's,
       Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on
     The fate of nations;—but this Russ so witty
     Could rhyme, like Nero, o'er a burning city.
     He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,
       Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,
     Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it—
       For I will teach, if possible, the stones
     To rise against earth's tyrants. Never let it
       Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;—
     But ye—our children's children! think how we
     Show'd what things were before the world was free!
     That hour is not for us, but 't is for you:
       And as, in the great joy of your millennium,
     You hardly will believe such things were true
       As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;
     But may their very memory perish too!-
       Yet if perchance remember'd, still disdain you 'em
     More than you scorn the savages of yore,
     Who painted their bare limbs, but not with gore.
     And when you hear historians talk of thrones,
       And those that sate upon them, let it be
     As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,
       'And wonder what old world such things could see,
     Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,
       The pleasant riddles of futurity—
     Guessing at what shall happily be hid,
     As the real purpose of a pyramid.
     Reader! I have kept my word,—at least so far
       As the first Canto promised. You have now
     Had sketches of love, tempest, travel, war—
       All very accurate, you must allow,
     And epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;
       For I have drawn much less with a long bow
     Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,
     But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,
     With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.
       What farther hath befallen or may befall
     The hero of this grand poetic riddle,
       I by and by may tell you, if at all:
     But now I choose to break off in the middle,
       Worn out with battering Ismail's stubborn wall,
     While Juan is sent off with the despatch,
     For which all Petersburgh is on the watch.
     This special honour was conferr'd, because
       He had behaved with courage and humanity—
     Which last men like, when they have time to pause
       From their ferocities produced by vanity.
     His little captive gain'd him some applause
       For saving her amidst the wild insanity
     Of carnage,—and I think he was more glad in her
     Safety, than his new order of St. Vladimir.
     The Moslem orphan went with her protector,
       For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all
     Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,
       Had perish'd in the field or by the wall:
     Her very place of birth was but a spectre
       Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's cal
     To prayer was heard no more!—and Juan wept,
     And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.
Canto 9
CANTO THE NINTH.
     O, Wellington! (or 'Villainton'—for Fame
       Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;
     France could not even conquer your great name,
       But punn'd it down to this facetious phrase—
     Beating or beaten she will laugh the same),
       You have obtain'd great pensions and much praise:
     Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,
     Humanity would rise, and thunder 'Nay!'
     I don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well
       In Marinet's affair—in fact, 't was shabby,
     And like some other things won't do to tell
       Upon your tomb in Westminster's old abbey.
     Upon the rest 't is not worth while to dwell,
       Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;
     But though your years as man tend fast to zero,
     In fact your grace is still but a young hero.
     Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,
       Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:
     You have repair'd Legitimacy's crutch,
       A prop not quite so certain as before:
     The Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,
       Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;
     And Waterloo has made the world your debtor
     (I wish your bards would sing it rather better).
     You are 'the best of cut-throats:'—do not start;
       The phrase is Shakspeare's, and not misapplied:
     War 's a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,
       Unless her cause by right be sanctified.
     If you have acted once a generous part,
       The world, not the world's masters, will decide,
     And I shall be delighted to learn who,
     Save you and yours, have gain'd by Waterloo?
     I am no flatterer—you 've supp'd full of flattery:
       They say you like it too—'t is no great wonder.
     He whose whole life has been assault and battery,
       At last may get a little tired of thunder;
     And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he
       May like being praised for every lucky blunder,
     Call'd 'Saviour of the Nations'—not yet saved,
     And 'Europe's Liberator'—still enslaved.
     I 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate
       Presented by the Prince of the Brazils,
     And send the sentinel before your gate
       A slice or two from your luxurious meals:
     He fought, but has not fed so well of late.
       Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:—
     There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,
     But pray give back a little to the nation.
     I don't mean to reflect—a man so great as
       You, my lord duke! is far above reflection:
     The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,
       With modern history has but small connection:
     Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,
       You need not take them under your direction;
     And half a million for your Sabine farm
     Is rather dear!—I 'm sure I mean no harm.
     Great men have always scorn'd great recompenses:
       Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,
     Not leaving even his funeral expenses:
       George Washington had thanks and nought beside,
     Except the all-cloudless glory which few men's is
       To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,
     And as a high-soul'd minister of state is
     Renown'd for ruining Great Britain gratis.
     Never had mortal man such opportunity,
       Except Napoleon, or abused it more:
     You might have freed fallen Europe from the unity
       Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:
     And now—what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?
       Now—that the rabble's first vain shouts are o'er?
     Go! hear it in your famish'd country's cries!
     Behold the world! and curse your victories!
     As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,
       To you the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe
     Truths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,
       But which 't is time to teach the hireling tribe
     Who fatten on their country's gore, and debts,
       Must be recited, and—without a bribe.
     You did great things; but not being great in mind,
     Have left undone the greatest—and mankind.
     Death laughs—Go ponder o'er the skeleton
       With which men image out the unknown thing
     That hides the past world, like to a set sun
       Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring—
     Death laughs at all you weep for:—look upon
       This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting
     Turns life to terror, even though in its sheath:
     Mark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!
     Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!
       And yet was what you are: from ear to ear
     It laughs not—there is now no fleshy bar
       So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,
     But still he smiles; and whether near or far,
       He strips from man that mantle (far more dear
     Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,
     White, black, or copper—the dead bones will grin.
     And thus Death laughs,—it is sad merriment,
       But still it is so; and with such example
     Why should not Life be equally content
       With his superior, in a smile to trample
     Upon the nothings which are daily spent
       Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample
     Than the eternal deluge, which devours
     Suns as rays—worlds like atoms—years like hours?
     'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'
       Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.
     I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,
       Nor ever had for abstract fame much passion;
     But would much rather have a sound digestion
       Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on
     Through fifty victories to shame or fame—
     Without a stomach what were a good name?
     'O dura ilia messorum!'—'Oh
       Ye rigid guts of reapers!' I translate
     For the great benefit of those who know
       What indigestion is—that inward fate
     Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.
       A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:
     Let this one toil for bread—that rack for rent,
     He who sleeps best may be the most content.
     'To be, or not to be?'—Ere I decide,
       I should be glad to know that which is being?
     'T is true we speculate both far and wide,
       And deem, because we see, we are all-seeing:
     For my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,
       Until I see both sides for once agreeing.
     For me, I sometimes think that life is death,
     Rather than life a mere affair of breath.
     'Que scais-je?' was the motto of Montaigne,
       As also of the first academicians:
     That all is dubious which man may attain,
       Was one of their most favourite positions.
     There 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain
       As any of Mortality's conditions;
     So little do we know what we 're about in
     This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.
     It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,
       Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;
     But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?
       Your wise men don't know much of navigation;
     And swimming long in the abyss of thought
       Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station
     Well nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers
     Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.
     'But heaven,' as Cassio says, 'is above all—
       No more of this, then,—let us pray!' We have
     Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,
       Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,
     Besides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall
       Is special providence,' though how it gave
     Offence, we know not; probably it perch'd
     Upon the tree which Eve so fondly search'd.
     O, ye immortal gods! what is theogony?
       O, thou too, mortal man! what is philanthropy?
     O, world! which was and is, what is cosmogony?
       Some people have accused me of misanthropy;
     And yet I know no more than the mahogany
       That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy
     I comprehend, for without transformation
     Men become wolves on any slight occasion.
     But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,
       Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er
     Done anything exceedingly unkind,—
       And (though I could not now and then forbear
     Following the bent of body or of mind)
       Have always had a tendency to spare,—
     Why do they call me misanthrope? Because
     They hate me, not I them.—and here we 'll pause.
     'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,—
       For I maintain that it is really good,
     Not only in the body but the proem,
       However little both are understood
     Just now,—but by and by the Truth will show 'em
       Herself in her sublimest attitude:
     And till she doth, I fain must be content
     To share her beauty and her banishment.
     Our hero (and, I trust, kind reader, yours)
       Was left upon his way to the chief city
     Of the immortal Peter's polish'd boors
       Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.
     I know its mighty empire now allures
       Much flattery—even Voltaire's, and that 's a pity.
     For me, I deem an absolute autocrat
     Not a barbarian, but much worse than that.
     And I will war, at least in words (and—should
       My chance so happen—deeds), with all who war
     With Thought;—and of Thought's foes by far most rude,
       Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.
     I know not who may conquer: if I could
       Have such a prescience, it should be no bar
     To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation
     Of every depotism in every nation.
     It is not that I adulate the people:
       Without me, there are demagogues enough,
     And infidels, to pull down every steeple,
       And set up in their stead some proper stuff.
     Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell,
       As is the Christian dogma rather rough,
     I do not know;—I wish men to be free
     As much from mobs as kings—from you as me.
     The consequence is, being of no party,
       I shall offend all parties: never mind!
     My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty
       Than if I sought to sail before the wind.
     He who has nought to gain can have small art: he
       Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,
     May still expatiate freely, as will I,
     Nor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.
     That 's an appropriate simile, that jackal;—
       I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl
     By night, as do that mercenary pack all,
       Power's base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,
     And scent the prey their masters would attack all.
       However, the poor jackals are less foul
     (As being the brave lions' keen providers)
     Than human insects, catering for spiders.
     Raise but an arm! 't will brush their web away,
       And without that, their poison and their claws
     Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say
       (Or rather peoples)—go on without pause!
     The web of these tarantulas each day
       Increases, till you shall make common cause:
     None, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,
     As yet are strongly stinging to be free.
     Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,
       Was left upon his way with the despatch,
     Where blood was talk'd of as we would of water;
       And carcasses that lay as thick as thatch
     O'er silenced cities, merely served to flatter
       Fair Catherine's pastime—who look'd on the match
     Between these nations as a main of cocks,
     Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.
     And there in a kibitka he roll'd on
       (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,
     Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone),
       Pondering on glory, chivalry, and kings,
     And orders, and on all that he had done—
       And wishing that post-horses had the wings
     Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises
     Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.
     At every jolt—and they were many—still
       He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,
     As if he wish'd that she should fare less ill
       Than he, in these sad highways left at large
     To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,
       Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge
     On her canals, where God takes sea and land,
     Fishery and farm, both into his own hand.
     At least he pays no rent, and has best right
       To be the first of what we used to call
     'Gentlemen farmer'—a race worn out quite,
       Since lately there have been no rents at all,
     And 'gentlemen' are in a piteous plight,
       And 'farmers' can't raise Ceres from her fall:
     She fell with Buonaparte—What strange thoughts
     Arise, when we see emperors fall with oats!
     But Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child
       Whom he had saved from slaughter—what a trophy
     O! ye who build up monuments, defiled
       With gore, like Nadir Shah, that costive sophy,
     Who, after leaving Hindostan a wild,
       And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee
     To soothe his woes withal, was slain, the sinner!
     Because he could no more digest his dinner;—
     O ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,
       That one life saved, especially if young
     Or pretty, is a thing to recollect
       Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung
     From the manure of human clay, though deck'd
       With all the praises ever said or sung:
     Though hymn'd by every harp, unless within
     Your heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.
     O! ye great authors luminous, voluminous!
       Ye twice ten hundred thousand daily scribes!
     Whose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!
       Whether you 're paid by government in bribes,
     To prove the public debt is not consuming us—
       Or, roughly treading on the 'courtier's kibes'
     With clownish heel, your popular circulation
     Feeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;—
     O, ye great authors!—'Apropos des bottes,'-
       I have forgotten what I meant to say,
     As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;
       'T was something calculated to allay
     All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:
       Certes it would have been but thrown away,
     And that 's one comfort for my lost advice,
     Although no doubt it was beyond all price.
     But let it go:—it will one day be found
       With other relics of 'a former world,'
     When this world shall be former, underground,
       Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp'd, and curl'd,
     Baked, fried, or burnt, turn'd inside-out, or drown'd,
       Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd
     First out of, and then back again to chaos,
     The superstratum which will overlay us.
     So Cuvier says;—and then shall come again
       Unto the new creation, rising out
     From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain
       Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:
     Like to the notions we now entertain
       Of Titans, giants, fellows of about
     Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,
     And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.
     Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!
       How the new worldlings of the then new East
     Will wonder where such animals could sup!
       (For they themselves will be but of the least:
     Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,
       And every new creation hath decreased
     In size, from overworking the material—
     Men are but maggots of some huge Earth's burial.)
     How will—to these young people, just thrust out
       From some fresh Paradise, and set to plough,
     And dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,
       And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,
     Till all the arts at length are brought about,
       Especially of war and taxing,—how,
     I say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,
     Look like the monsters of a new museum?
     But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:
       'The time is out of joint,'—and so am I;
     I quite forget this poem 's merely quizzical,
       And deviate into matters rather dry.
     I ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I cal
       Much too poetical: men should know why
     They write, and for what end; but, note or text,
     I never know the word which will come next.
     So on I ramble, now and then narrating,
       Now pondering:—it is time we should narrate.
     I left Don Juan with his horses baiting—
       Now we 'll get o'er the ground at a great rate.
     I shall not be particular in stating
       His journey, we 've so many tours of late:
     Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose
     That pleasant capital of painted snows;
     Suppose him in a handsome uniform,—
       A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,
     Waving, like sails new shiver'd in a storm,
       Over a cock'd hat in a crowded room,
     And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,
       Of yellow casimere we may presume,
     White stocking drawn uncurdled as new milk
     O'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;
     Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,
       Made up by youth, fame, and an army tailor—
     That great enchanter, at whose rod's command
       Beauty springs forth, and Nature's self turns paler,
     Seeing how Art can make her work more grand
       (When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),—
     Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He
     Seems Love turn'd a lieutenant of artillery:—
     His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;
       His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver
     Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at
       His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;
     His bow converted into a cock'd hat;
       But still so like, that Psyche were more clever
     Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),
     If she had not mistaken him for Cupid.
     The courtiers stared, the ladies whisper'd, and
       The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown'd—
     I quite forget which of them was in hand
       Just then; as they are rather numerous found,
     Who took by turns that difficult command
       Since first her majesty was singly crown'd:
     But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,
     All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.
     Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,
       Blushing and beardless; and yet ne'ertheless
     There was a something in his turn of limb,
       And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,
     That though he look'd one of the seraphim,
       There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.
     Besides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,
     And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.
     No wonder then that Yermoloff, or Momonoff,
       Or Scherbatoff, or any other off
     Or on, might dread her majesty had not room enough
       Within her bosom (which was not too tough)
     For a new flame; a thought to cast of gloom enough
       Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,
     Of him who, in the language of his station,
     Then held that 'high official situation.'
     O, gentle ladies! should you seek to know
       The import of this diplomatic phrase,
     Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show
       His parts of speech; and in the strange displays
     Of that odd string of words, all in a row,
       Which none divine, and every one obeys,
     Perhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,
     Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.
     I think I can explain myself without
       That sad inexplicable beast of prey—
     That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,
       Did not his deeds unriddle them each day—
     That monstrous hieroglyphic—that long spout
       Of blood and water, leaden Castlereagh!
     And here I must an anecdote relate,
     But luckily of no great length or weight.
     An English lady ask'd of an Italian,
       What were the actual and official duties
     Of the strange thing some women set a value on,
       Which hovers oft about some married beauties,
     Called 'Cavalier servente?'—a Pygmalion
       Whose statues warm (I fear, alas! too true 't is)
     Beneath his art. The dame, press'd to disclose them,
     Said—'Lady, I beseech you to suppose them.'
     And thus I supplicate your supposition,
       And mildest, matron-like interpretation,
     Of the imperial favourite's condition.
       'T was a high place, the highest in the nation
     In fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion
       Of any one's attaining to his station,
     No doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,
     If rather broad, made stocks rise and their holders.
     Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,
       And had retain'd his boyish look beyond
     The usual hirsute seasons which destroy,
       With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond
     Parisian aspect which upset old Troy
       And founded Doctors' Commons:—I have conn'd
     The history of divorces, which, though chequer'd,
     Calls Ilion's the first damages on record.
     And Catherine, who loved all things (save her lord,
       Who was gone to his place), and pass'd for much
     Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorr'd)
       Gigantic gentlemen, yet had a touch
     Of sentiment; and he she most adored
       Was the lamented Lanskoi, who was such
     A lover as had cost her many a tear,
     And yet but made a middling grenadier.
     O thou 'teterrima causa' of all 'belli'-
       Thou gate of life and death—thou nondescript!
     Whence is our exit and our entrance,—well I
       May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt
     In thy perennial fountain:—how man fell I
       Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript
     Of her first fruit; but how he falls and rises
     Since, thou hast settled beyond all surmises.
     Some call thee 'the worst cause of war,' but I
       Maintain thou art the best: for after all
     From thee we come, to thee we go, and why
       To get at thee not batter down a wall,
     Or waste a world? since no one can deny
       Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:
     With, or without thee, all things at a stand
     Are, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!
     Catherine, who was the grand epitome
       Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what
     You please (it causes all the things which be,
       So you may take your choice of this or that)—
     Catherine, I say, was very glad to see
       The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat
     Victory; and pausing as she saw him kneel
     With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.
     Then recollecting the whole empress, nor
       forgetting quite the woman (which composed
     At least three parts of this great whole), she tore
       The letter open with an air which posed
     The court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,
       Until a royal smile at length disclosed
     Fair weather for the day. Though rather spacious,
     Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.
     Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first
       Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain.
     Glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,
       As an East Indian sunrise on the main.
     These quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst—
       So Arab deserts drink in summer's rain:
     In vain!—As fall the dews on quenchless sands,
     Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!
     Her next amusement was more fanciful;
       She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw
     Into a Russian couplet rather dull
       The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.
     Her third was feminine enough to annul
       The shudder which runs naturally through
     Our veins, when things call'd sovereigns think it best
     To kill, and generals turn it into jest.
     The two first feelings ran their course complete,
       And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:
     The whole court look'd immediately most sweet,
       Like flowers well water'd after a long drouth.
     But when on the lieutenant at her feet
       Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth
     Almost as much as on a new despatch,
     Glanced mildly, all the world was on the watch.
     Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,
       When wroth—while pleased, she was as fine a figure
     As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,
       Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.
     She could repay each amatory look you lent
       With interest, and in turn was wont with rigour
     To exact of Cupid's bills the full amount
     At sight, nor would permit you to discount.
     With her the latter, though at times convenient,
       Was not so necessary; for they tell
     That she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,
       And always used her favourites too well.
     If once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,
       Your 'fortune' was in a fair way 'to swell
     A man' (as Giles says); for though she would widow all
     Nations, she liked man as an individual.
     What a strange thing is man? and what a stranger
       Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head,
     And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger
       Is all the rest about her! Whether wed
     Or widow, maid or mother, she can change her
       Mind like the wind: whatever she has said
     Or done, is light to what she 'll say or do;—
     The oldest thing on record, and yet new!
     O Catherine! (for of all interjections,
       To thee both oh! and ah! belong of right
     In love and war) how odd are the connections
       Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!
     Just now yours were cut out in different sections:
       First Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;
     Next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;
     And thirdly he who brought you the despatch!
     Shakspeare talks of 'the herald Mercury
       New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;'
     And some such visions cross'd her majesty,
       While her young herald knelt before her still.
     'T is very true the hill seem'd rather high,
       For a lieutenant to climb up; but skill
     Smooth'd even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing
     With youth and health all kisses are 'heaven-kissing.'
     Her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up—
       And so they fell in love;—she with his face,
     His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup
       With the first draught intoxicates apace,
     A quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'
       Which makes one drunk at once, without the base
     Expedient of full bumpers; for the eye
     In love drinks all life's fountains (save tears) dry.
     He, on the other hand, if not in love,
       Fell into that no less imperious passion,
     Self-love—which, when some sort of thing above
       Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,
     Or duchess, princess, empress, 'deigns to prove'
       ('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,
     For one especial person out of many,
     Makes us believe ourselves as good as any.
     Besides, he was of that delighted age
       Which makes all female ages equal—when
     We don't much care with whom we may engage,
       As bold as Daniel in the lion's den,
     So that we can our native sun assuage
       In the next ocean, which may flow just then,
     To make a twilight in, just as Sol's heat is
     Quench'd in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.
     And Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),
       Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing
     Whose temporary passion was quite flattering,
       Because each lover look'd a sort of king,
     Made up upon an amatory pattern,
       A royal husband in all save the ring—
     Which, being the damn'dest part of matrimony,
     Seem'd taking out the sting to leave the honey.
     And when you add to this, her womanhood
       In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray
     (The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,
       Or better, as the best examples say:
     Napoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should
       Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;
     And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,
     Too wise to look through optics black or blue)—
     Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,
       Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,
     Her preference of a boy to men much bigger
       (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),
     Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,
       With other extras, which we need not mention,—
     All these, or any one of these, explain
     Enough to make a stripling very vain.
     And that 's enough, for love is vanity,
       Selfish in its beginning as its end,
     Except where 't is a mere insanity,
       A maddening spirit which would strive to blend
     Itself with beauty's frail inanity,
       On which the passion's self seems to depend:
     And hence some heathenish philosophers
     Make love the main spring of the universe.
     Besides Platonic love, besides the love
       Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving
     Of faithful pairs (I needs must rhyme with dove,
       That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving
     'Gainst reason—Reason ne'er was hand-and-glove
       With rhyme, but always leant less to improving
     The sound than sense)—beside all these pretences
     To love, there are those things which words name senses;
     Those movements, those improvements in our bodies
       Which make all bodies anxious to get out
     Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,
       For such all women are at first no doubt.
     How beautiful that moment! and how odd is
       That fever which precedes the languid rout
     Of our sensations! What a curious way
     The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!
     The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,
       To end or to begin with; the next grand
     Is that which may be christen'd love canonical,
       Because the clergy take the thing in hand;
     The third sort to be noted in our chronicle
       As flourishing in every Christian land,
     Is when chaste matrons to their other ties
     Add what may be call'd marriage in disguise.
     Well, we won't analyse—our story must
       Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,
     Juan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;—
       I cannot stop to alter words once written,
     And the two are so mix'd with human dust,
       That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:
     But in such matters Russia's mighty empress
     Behaved no better than a common sempstress.
     The whole court melted into one wide whisper,
       And all lips were applied unto all ears!
     The elder ladies' wrinkles curl'd much crisper
       As they beheld; the younger cast some leers
     On one another, and each lovely lisper
       Smiled as she talk'd the matter o'er; but tears
     Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye
     Of all the standing army who stood by.
     All the ambassadors of all the powers
       Enquired, Who was this very new young man,
     Who promised to be great in some few hours?
       Which is full soon—though life is but a span.
     Already they beheld the silver showers
       Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,
     Upon his cabinet, besides the presents
     Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.
     Catherine was generous,—all such ladies are:
       Love, that great opener of the heart and all
     The ways that lead there, be they near or far,
       Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,—
     Love (though she had a cursed taste for war,
       And was not the best wife, unless we call
     Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better
     That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)—
     Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,
       Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,
     Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,
       If history, the grand liar, ever saith
     The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,
       Because she put a favourite to death,
     Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,
     And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.
     But when the levee rose, and all was bustle
       In the dissolving circle, all the nations'
     Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle
       Round the young man with their congratulations.
     Also the softer silks were heard to rustle
       Of gentle dames, among whose recreations
     It is to speculate on handsome faces,
     Especially when such lead to high places.
     Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,
       A general object of attention, made
     His answers with a very graceful bow,
       As if born for the ministerial trade.
     Though modest, on his unembarrass'd brow
       Nature had written 'gentleman.' He said
     Little, but to the purpose; and his manner
     Flung hovering graces o'er him like a banner.
     An order from her majesty consign'd
       Our young lieutenant to the genial care
     Of those in office: all the world look'd kind
       (As it will look sometimes with the first stare,
     Which youth would not act ill to keep in mind),
       As also did Miss Protasoff then there,
     Named from her mystic office 'l'Eprouveuse,'
     A term inexplicable to the Muse.
     With her then, as in humble duty bound,
       Juan retired,—and so will I, until
     My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.
       We have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'
     So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,
       And all my fancies whirling like a mill;
     Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,
     To take a quiet ride in some green Lane.
Canto 10
CANTO THE TENTH.
     When Newton saw an apple fall, he found
       In that slight startle from his contemplation—
     'T is said (for I 'll not answer above ground
       For any sage's creed or calculation)—
     A mode of proving that the earth turn'd round
       In a most natural whirl, called 'gravitation;'
     And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,
     Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.
     Man fell with apples, and with apples rose,
       If this be true; for we must deem the mode
     In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose
       Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,
     A thing to counterbalance human woes:
       For ever since immortal man hath glow'd
     With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon
     Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.
     And wherefore this exordium?—Why, just now,
       In taking up this paltry sheet of paper,
     My bosom underwent a glorious glow,
       And my internal spirit cut a caper:
     And though so much inferior, as I know,
       To those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,
     Discover stars and sail in the wind's eye,
     I wish to do as much by poesy.
     In the wind's eye I have sail'd, and sail; but for
       The stars, I own my telescope is dim:
     But at least I have shunn'd the common shore,
       And leaving land far out of sight, would skim
     The ocean of eternity: the roar
       Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,
     But still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float
     Where ships have founder'd, as doth many a boat.
     We left our hero, Juan, in the bloom
       Of favouritism, but not yet in the blush;
     And far be it from my Muses to presume
       (For I have more than one Muse at a push)
     To follow him beyond the drawing-room:
       It is enough that Fortune found him flush
     Of youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things
     Which for an instant clip enjoyment's wings.
     But soon they grow again and leave their nest.
       'Oh!' saith the Psalmist, 'that I had a dove's
     Pinions to flee away, and be at rest!'
       And who that recollects young years and loves,—
     Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,
       And palsied fancy, which no longer roves
     Beyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,—but would much rather
     Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?
     But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,
       Like Arno in the summer, to a shallow,
     So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,
       Which threatens inundations deep and yellow!
     Such difference doth a few months make. You 'd think
       Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;
     No more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,
     Who furrow some new soil to sow for joys.
     But coughs will come when sighs depart—and now
       And then before sighs cease; for oft the one
     Will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow
       Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun
     Of life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,
       Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,
     O'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,
     Thousands blaze, love, hope, die,—how happy they!
     But Juan was not meant to die so soon.
       We left him in the focus of such glory
     As may be won by favour of the moon
       Or ladies' fancies—rather transitory
     Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,
       Because December, with his breath so hoary,
     Must come? Much rather should he court the ray,
     To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.
     Besides, he had some qualities which fix
       Middle-aged ladies even more than young:
     The former know what 's what; while new-fledged chicks
       Know little more of love than what is sung
     In rhymes, or dreamt (for fancy will play tricks)
       In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.
     Some reckon women by their suns or years,
     I rather think the moon should date the dears.
     And why? because she 's changeable and chaste.
       I know no other reason, whatsoe'er
     Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,
       May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,
     Nor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'
       As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:
     However, I forgive him, and I trust
     He will forgive himself;—if not, I must.
     Old enemies who have become new friends
       Should so continue—'t is a point of honour;
     And I know nothing which could make amends
       For a return to hatred: I would shun her
     Like garlic, howsoever she extends
       Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.
     Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes—
     Converted foes should scorn to join with those.
     This were the worst desertion:—renegadoes,
       Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,
     Would scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'
       Whom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:
     And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,
       Whether in Caledon or Italy,
     Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize
     To pain, the moment when you cease to please.
     The lawyer and the critic but behold
       The baser sides of literature and life,
     And nought remains unseen, but much untold,
       By those who scour those double vales of strife.
     While common men grow ignorantly old,
       The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,
     Dissecting the whole inside of a question,
     And with it all the process of digestion.
     A legal broom 's a moral chimney-sweeper,
       And that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;
     The endless soot bestows a tint far deeper
       Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he
     Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,
       At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,
     In all their habits;—not so you, I own;
     As Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.
     And all our little feuds, at least all mine,
       Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe
     (As far as rhyme and criticism combine
       To make such puppets of us things below),
     Are over: Here 's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'
       I do not know you, and may never know
     Your face—but you have acted on the whole
     Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.
     And when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'
       'T is not address'd to you—the more 's the pity
     For me, for I would rather take my wine
       With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.
     But somehow,—it may seem a schoolboy's whine,
       And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,
     But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred
     A whole one, and my heart flies to my head,—
     As 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,
       Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,
     The Dee, the Don, Balgounie's brig's black wall,
       All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams
     Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,
       Like Banquo's offspring;—floating past me seems
     My childhood in this childishness of mine:
     I care not—'t is a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'
     And though, as you remember, in a fit
       Of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,
     I rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit,
       Which must be own'd was sensitive and surly,
     Yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,
       They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:
     I 'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood,
     And love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'
     Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,—
       For both are much the same, since what men think
     Exists when the once thinkers are less real
       Than what they thought, for mind can never sink,
     And 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;
       And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink
     Of what is call'd eternity, to stare,
     And know no more of what is here, than there;—
     Don Juan grew a very polish'd Russian—
       How we won't mention, why we need not say:
     Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion
       Of any slight temptation in their way;
     But his just now were spread as is a cushion
       Smooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay
     Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,
     Made ice seem paradise, and winter sunny.
     The favour of the empress was agreeable;
       And though the duty wax'd a little hard,
     Young people at his time of life should be able
       To come off handsomely in that regard.
     He was now growing up like a green tree, able
       For love, war, or ambition, which reward
     Their luckier votaries, till old age's tedium
     Make some prefer the circulating medium.
     About this time, as might have been anticipated,
       Seduced by youth and dangerous examples,
     Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;
       Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples
     On our fresh feelings, but—as being participated
       With all kinds of incorrigible samples
     Of frail humanity—must make us selfish,
     And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.
     This we pass over. We will also pass
       The usual progress of intrigues between
     Unequal matches, such as are, alas!
       A young lieutenant's with a not old queen,
     But one who is not so youthful as she was
       In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.
     Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,
     And Death, the sovereign's sovereign, though the great
       Gracchus of all mortality, who levels
     With his Agrarian laws the high estate
       Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,
     To one small grass-grown patch (which must await
       Corruption for its crop) with the poor devils
     Who never had a foot of land till now,—
     Death 's a reformer, all men must allow.
     He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry
       Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,
     In this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry—
       Which (though I hate to say a thing that 's bitter)
     Peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,
       Through all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter
     For Babylon's than Russia's royal harlot—
     And neutralize her outward show of scarlet.
     And this same state we won't describe: we would
       Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;
     But getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'
       That horrid equinox, that hateful section
     Of human years, that half-way house, that rude
       Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection
     Life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier
     Of age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;—
     I won't describe,—that is, if I can help
       Description; and I won't reflect,—that is,
     If I can stave off thought, which—as a whelp
       Clings to its teat—sticks to me through the abyss
     Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp
       Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss
     Drains its first draught of lips:—but, as I said,
     I won't philosophise, and will be read.
     Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,—
       A thing which happens rarely: this he owed
     Much to his youth, and much to his reported
       Valour; much also to the blood he show'd,
     Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,
       Which set the beauty off in which he glow'd,
     As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most
     He owed to an old woman and his post.
     He wrote to Spain:—and all his near relations,
       Perceiving fie was in a handsome way
     Of getting on himself, and finding stations
       For cousins also, answer'd the same day.
     Several prepared themselves for emigrations;
       And eating ices, were o'erheard to say,
     That with the addition of a slight pelisse,
     Madrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.
     His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,
       That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,
     Where his assets were waxing rather few,
       He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,—
     Replied, 'that she was glad to see him through
       Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;
     As the sole sign of man's being in his senses
     Is, learning to reduce his past expenses.
     'She also recommended him to God,
       And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,
     Warn'd him against Greek worship, which looks odd
       In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother
     Outward dislike, which don't look well abroad;
       Inform'd him that he had a little brother
     Born in a second wedlock; and above
     All, praised the empress's maternal love.
     'She could not too much give her approbation
       Unto an empress, who preferr'd young men
     Whose age, and what was better still, whose nation
       And climate, stopp'd all scandal (now and then):—
     At home it might have given her some vexation;
       But where thermometers sunk down to ten,
     Or five, or one, or zero, she could never
     Believe that virtue thaw'd before the river.'
     O for a forty-parson power to chant
       Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn
     Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,
       Not practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!
     Or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,
       Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,
     Drew quiet consolation through its hint,
     When she no more could read the pious print.
     She was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,
       But went to heaven in as sincere a way
     As any body on the elected roll,
       Which portions out upon the judgment day
     Heaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,
       Such as the conqueror William did repay
     His knights with, lotting others' properties
     Into some sixty thousand new knights' fees.
     I can't complain, whose ancestors are there,
       Erneis, Radulphus—eight-and-forty manors
     (If that my memory doth not greatly err)
       Were their reward for following Billy's banners:
     And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair
       To strip the Saxons of their hydes, like tanners;
     Yet as they founded churches with the produce,
     You 'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.
     The gentle Juan flourish'd, though at times
       He felt like other plants called sensitive,
     Which shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,
       Save such as Southey can afford to give.
     Perhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes
       In which the Neva's ice would cease to live
     Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,
     In royalty's vast arms he sigh d for beauty:
     Perhaps—but, sans perhaps, we need not seek
       For causes young or old: the canker-worm
     Will feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,
       As well as further drain the wither'd form:
     Care, like a housekeeper, brings every week
       His bills in, and however we may storm,
     They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,
     The seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.
     I don't know how it was, but he grew sick:
       The empress was alarm'd, and her physician
     (The same who physick'd Peter) found the tick
       Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition
     Which augur'd of the dead, however quick
       Itself, and show'd a feverish disposition;
     At which the whole court was extremely troubled,
     The sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.
     Low were the whispers, manifold the rumours:
       Some said he had been poison'd by Potemkin;
     Others talk'd learnedly of certain tumours,
       Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;
     Some said 't was a concoction of the humours,
       Which with the blood too readily will claim kin;
     Others again were ready to maintain,
     ''T was only the fatigue of last campaign.'
     But here is one prescription out of many:
       'Sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.
     Aq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae
       Haustus' (And here the surgeon came and cupp'd him)
     'Rx Pulv Com gr. iij. Ipecacuanhae'
       (With more beside if Juan had not stopp'd 'em).
     'Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus,
     Et haustus ter in die capiendus.'
     This is the way physicians mend or end us,
       Secundum artem: but although we sneer
     In health—when ill, we call them to attend us,
       Without the least propensity to jeer:
     While that 'hiatus maxime deflendus'
       To be fill'd up by spade or mattock's near,
     Instead of gliding graciously down Lethe,
     We tease mild Baillie, or soft Abernethy.
     Juan demurr'd at this first notice to
       Quit; and though death had threaten'd an ejection,
     His youth and constitution bore him through,
       And sent the doctors in a new direction.
     But still his state was delicate: the hue
       Of health but flicker'd with a faint reflection
     Along his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel
     The faculty—who said that he must travel.
     The climate was too cold, they said, for him,
       Meridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion
     Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,
       Who did not like at first to lose her minion:
     But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,
       And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,
     She then resolved to send him on a mission,
     But in a style becoming his condition.
     There was just then a kind of a discussion,
       A sort of treaty or negotiation
     Between the British cabinet and Russian,
       Maintain'd with all the due prevarication
     With which great states such things are apt to push on;
       Something about the Baltic's navigation,
     Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,
     Which Britons deem their 'uti possidetis.'
     So Catherine, who had a handsome way
       Of fitting out her favourites, conferr'd
     This secret charge on Juan, to display
       At once her royal splendour, and reward
     His services. He kiss'd hands the next day,
       Received instructions how to play his card,
     Was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,
     Which show'd what great discernment was the donor's.
     But she was lucky, and luck 's all. Your queens
       Are generally prosperous in reigning;
     Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means.
       But to continue: though her years were waning
     Her climacteric teased her like her teens;
       And though her dignity brook'd no complaining,
     So much did Juan's setting off distress her,
     She could not find at first a fit successor.
     But time, the comforter, will come at last;
       And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number
     Of candidates requesting to be placed,
       Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:—
     Not that she meant to fix again in haste,
       Nor did she find the quantity encumber,
     But always choosing with deliberation,
     Kept the place open for their emulation.
     While this high post of honour 's in abeyance,
       For one or two days, reader, we request
     You 'll mount with our young hero the conveyance
       Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best
     Barouche, which had the glory to display once
       The fair czarina's autocratic crest,
     When, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,
     Was given to her favourite, and now bore his.
     A bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,
       All private favourites of Don Juan;—for
     (Let deeper sages the true cause determine)
       He had a kind of inclination, or
     Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,
       Live animals: an old maid of threescore
     For cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,
     Although he was not old, nor even a maid;—
     The animals aforesaid occupied
       Their station: there were valets, secretaries,
     In other vehicles; but at his side
       Sat little Leila, who survived the parries
     He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide
       Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies
     Her note, she don't forget the infant girl
     Whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl
     Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,
       And with that gentle, serious character,
     As rare in living beings as a fossile
       Man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, 'grand Cuvier!'
     Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle
       With this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:
     But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore
     Was tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.
     Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as
       Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.
     I cannot tell exactly what it was;
       He was not yet quite old enough to prove
     Parental feelings, and the other class,
       Call'd brotherly affection, could not move
     His bosom,—for he never had a sister:
     Ah! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!
     And still less was it sensual; for besides
       That he was not an ancient debauchee
     (Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,
       As acids rouse a dormant alkali),
     Although ('t will happen as our planet guides)
       His youth was not the chastest that might be,
     There was the purest Platonism at bottom
     Of all his feelings—only he forgot 'em.
     Just now there was no peril of temptation;
       He loved the infant orphan he had saved,
     As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;
       His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved
     Owing to him;—as also her salvation
       Through his means and the church's might be paved.
     But one thing 's odd, which here must be inserted,
     The little Turk refused to be converted.
     'T was strange enough she should retain the impression
       Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;
     But though three bishops told her the transgression,
       She show'd a great dislike to holy water:
     She also had no passion for confession;
       Perhaps she had nothing to confess:—no matter,
     Whate'er the cause, the church made little of it—
     She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.
     In fact, the only Christian she could bear
       Was Juan; whom she seem'd to have selected
     In place of what her home and friends once were.
       He naturally loved what he protected:
     And thus they form'd a rather curious pair,
       A guardian green in years, a ward connected
     In neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;
     And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.
     They journey'd on through Poland and through Warsaw,
       Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:
     Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw
       Which gave her dukes the graceless name of 'Biron.'
     'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,
       Who march'd to Moscow, led by Fame, the siren!
     To lose by one month's frost some twenty years
     Of conquest, and his guard of grenadiers.
     Let this not seem an anti-climax:—'Oh!
       My guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day.
     Think of the Thunderer's falling down below
       Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!
     Alas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!
       But should we wish to warm us on our way
     Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name
     Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.
     From Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,
       And Konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,
     Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,
       Has lately been the great Professor Kant.
     Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper
       About philosophy, pursued his jaunt
     To Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions
     Have princes who spur more than their postilions.
     And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,
       Until he reach'd the castellated Rhine:—
     Ye glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike
       All phantasies, not even excepting mine;
     A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,
       Make my soul pass the equinoctial line
     Between the present and past worlds, and hover
     Upon their airy confine, half-seas-over.
     But Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,
       Which Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre
     Of the good feudal times forever gone,
       On which I have not time just now to lecture.
     From thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,
       A city which presents to the inspector
     Eleven thousand maidenheads of bone,
     The greatest number flesh hath ever known.
     From thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,
       That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,
     Where juniper expresses its best juice,
       The poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.
     Senates and sages have condemn'd its use—
       But to deny the mob a cordial, which is
     Too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,
     Good government has left them, seems but cruel.
     Here he embark'd, and with a flowing sail
       Went bounding for the island of the free,
     Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;
       High dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,
     And sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;
       But Juan, season'd, as he well might be,
     By former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs
     Which pass'd, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.
     At length they rose, like a white wall along
       The blue sea's border; and I Don Juan felt—
     What even young strangers feel a little strong
       At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt—
     A kind of pride that he should be among
       Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt
     Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,
     And made the very billows pay them toll.
     I 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,
       Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;
     But though I owe it little but my birth,
       I feel a mix'd regret and veneration
     For its decaying fame and former worth.
       Seven years (the usual term of transportation)
     Of absence lay one's old resentments level,
     When a man's country 's going to the devil.
     Alas! could she but fully, truly, know
       How her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:
     How eager all the earth is for the blow
       Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;
     How all the nations deem her their worst foe,
       That worse than worst of foes, the once adored
     False friend, who held out freedom to mankind,
     And now would chain them, to the very mind:—
     Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,
       Who is but first of slaves? The nations are
     In prison,—but the gaoler, what is he?
       No less a victim to the bolt and bar.
     Is the poor privilege to turn the key
       Upon the captive, freedom? He 's as far
     From the enjoyment of the earth and air
     Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.
     Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,
       Thy cliffs, dear Dover! harbour, and hotel;
     Thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;
       Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;
     Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties
       To those who upon land or water dwell;
     And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,
     Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.
     Juan, though careless, young, and magnifique,
       And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,
     Who did not limit much his bills per week,
       Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it
     (His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,
       Before him summ'd the awful scroll and read it);
     But doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,
     Is free, the respiration's worth the money.
     On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!
       Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;
     Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!
       Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle
     Along the road, as if they went to bury
       Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle
     With 'schnapps'—sad dogs! whom 'Hundsfot,' or 'Verflucter,'
     Affect no more than lightning a conductor.
     Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,
       Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,
     As going at full speed—no matter where its
       Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,
     And merely for the sake of its own merits;
       For the less cause there is for all this flurry,
     The greater is the pleasure in arriving
     At the great end of travel—which is driving.
     They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;
       Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,
     Were pointed out as usual by the bedral,
       In the same quaint, uninterested tone:—
     There 's glory again for you, gentle reader! All
       Ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,
     Half-solved into these sodas or magnesias;
     Which form that bitter draught, the human species.
     The effect on Juan was of course sublime:
       He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw
     That casque, which never stoop'd except to Time.
       Even the bold Churchman's tomb excited awe,
     Who died in the then great attempt to climb
       O'er kings, who now at least must talk of law
     Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,
     And ask'd why such a structure had been raised:
     And being told it was 'God's house,' she said
       He was well lodged, but only wonder'd how
     He suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,
       The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low
     His holy temples in the lands which bred
       The True Believers:—and her infant brow
     Was bent with grief that Mahomet should resign
     A mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.
     O! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,
       A paradise of hops and high production;
     For after years of travel by a bard in
       Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,
     A green field is a sight which makes him pardon
       The absence of that more sublime construction,
     Which mixes up vines, olives, precipices,
     Glaciers, volcanos, oranges, and ices.
     And when I think upon a pot of beer—
       But I won't weep!—and so drive on, postilions!
     As the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,
       Juan admired these highways of free millions;
     A country in all senses the most dear
       To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,
     Who 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,
     And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.
     What a delightful thing 's a turnpike road!
       So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving
     The earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad
       Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.
     Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god
       Had told his son to satisfy his craving
     With the York mail;—but onward as we roll,
     'Surgit amari aliquid'—the toll
     Alas, how deeply painful is all payment!
       Take lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:
     As Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,
       Such is the shortest way to general curses.
     They hate a murderer much less than a claimant
       On that sweet ore which every body nurses;—
     Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,
     But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.
     So said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken
       To your instructor. Juan now was borne,
     Just as the day began to wane and darken,
       O'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn
     Toward the great city.—Ye who have a spark in
       Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn
     According as you take things well or ill;—
     Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!
     The sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from
       A half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space
     Which well beseem'd the 'Devil's drawing-room,'
       As some have qualified that wondrous place:
     But Juan felt, though not approaching home,
       As one who, though he were not of the race,
     Revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,
     Who butcher'd half the earth, and bullied t' other.
     A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,
       Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye
     Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping
       In sight, then lost amidst the forestry
     Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping
       On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;
     A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown
     On a fool's head—and there is London Town!
     But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke
       Appear'd to him but as the magic vapour
     Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke
       The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):
     The gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke
       Are bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,
     Were nothing but the natural atmosphere,
     Extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.
     He paused—and so will I; as doth a crew
       Before they give their broadside. By and by,
     My gentle countrymen, we will renew
       Our old acquaintance; and at least I 'll try
     To tell you truths you will not take as true,
       Because they are so;—a male Mrs. Fry,
     With a soft besom will I sweep your halls,
     And brush a web or two from off the walls.
     O Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why
       Preach to poor rogues? And wherefore not begin
     With Carlton, or with other houses? Try
       Your head at harden'd and imperial sin.
     To mend the people 's an absurdity,
       A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,
     Unless you make their betters better:—Fy!
     I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.
     Teach them the decencies of good threescore;
       Cure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;
     Tell them that youth once gone returns no more,
       That hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;
     Tell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,
       Too dull even for the dullest of excesses,
     The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,
     A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.
     Tell them, though it may be perhaps too late,
       On life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,
     To set up vain pretence of being great,
       'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,
     The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;
       And tell them—But you won't, and I have prated
     Just now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle
     Like Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.
Canto 11

     When Bishop Berkeley said 'there was no matter,'
       And proved it—'t was no matter what he said:
     They say his system 't is in vain to batter,
       Too subtle for the airiest human head;
     And yet who can believe it? I would shatter
       Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,
     Or adamant, to find the world a spirit,
     And wear my head, denying that I wear it.
     What a sublime discovery 't was to make the
       Universe universal egotism,
     That all 's ideal—all ourselves: I 'll stake the
       World (be it what you will) that that 's no schism.
     O Doubt!—if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee;
       But which I doubt extremely—thou sole prism
     Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!
     Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.
     For ever and anon comes Indigestion,
       (Not the most 'dainty Ariel') and perplexes
     Our soarings with another sort of question:
       And that which after all my spirit vexes,
     Is, that I find no spot where man can rest eye on,
       Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,
     Of beings, stars, and this unriddled wonder,
     The world, which at the worst 's a glorious blunder—
     If it be chance; or if it be according
       To the old text, still better:—lest it should
     Turn out so, we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording,
       As several people think such hazards rude.
     They 're right; our days are too brief for affording
       Space to dispute what no one ever could
     Decide, and every body one day will
     Know very clearly—or at least lie still.
     And therefore will I leave off metaphysical
       Discussion, which is neither here nor there:
     If I agree that what is, is; then this I call
       Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;
     The truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:
       I don't know what the reason is—the air
     Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks
     Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.
     The first attack at once proved the Divinity
       (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);
     The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;
       The third, the usual Origin of Evil;
     The fourth at once establish'd the whole Trinity
       On so uncontrovertible a level,
     That I devoutly wish'd the three were four,
     On purpose to believe so much the more.
     To our Theme.—The man who has stood on the Acropolis,
       And look'd down over Attica; or he
     Who has sail'd where picturesque Constantinople is,
       Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea
     In small-eyed China's crockery-ware metropolis,
       Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,
     May not think much of London's first appearance—
     But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence?
     Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;
       Sunset the time, the place the same declivity
     Which looks along that vale of good and ill
       Where London streets ferment in full activity;
     While every thing around was calm and still,
       Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he
     Heard,—and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum
     Of cities, that boil over with their scum:—
     I say, Don Juan, wrapt in contemplation,
       Walk'd on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,
     And lost in wonder of so great a nation,
       Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.
     'And here,' he cried, 'is Freedom's chosen station;
       Here peals the people's voice, nor can entomb it
     Racks, prisons, inquisitions; resurrection
     Awaits it, each new meeting or election.
     'Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay
       But what they please; and if that things be dear,
     'T is only that they love to throw away
       Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.
     Here laws are all inviolate; none lay
       Traps for the traveller; every highway 's clear:
     Here-' he was interrupted by a knife,
     With,—'Damn your eyes! your money or your life!'
     These freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads
       In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter
     Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,
       Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,
     In which the heedless gentleman who gads
       Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,
     May find himself within that isle of riches
     Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches.
     Juan, who did not understand a word
       Of English, save their shibboleth, 'God damn!'
     And even that he had so rarely heard,
       He sometimes thought 't was only their 'Salam,'
     Or 'God be with you!'—and 't is not absurd
       To think so: for half English as I am
     (To my misfortune), never can I say
     I heard them wish 'God with you,' save that way;—
     Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,
       And being somewhat choleric and sudden,
     Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,
       And fired it into one assailant's pudding—
     Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,
       And roar'd out, as he writhed his native mud in,
     Unto his nearest follower or henchman,
     'Oh Jack! I 'm floor'd by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!'
     On which Jack and his train set off at speed,
       And Juan's suite, late scatter'd at a distance,
     Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,
       And offering, as usual, late assistance.
     Juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed
       As if his veins would pour out his existence,
     Stood calling out for bandages and lint,
     And wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint.
     'Perhaps,' thought he, 'it is the country's wont
       To welcome foreigners in this way: now
     I recollect some innkeepers who don't
       Differ, except in robbing with a bow,
     In lieu of a bare blade and brazen front.
       But what is to be done? I can't allow
     The fellow to lie groaning on the road:
     So take him up; I 'll help you with the load.'
     But ere they could perform this pious duty,
       The dying man cried, 'Hold! I 've got my gruel!
     O for a glass of max! We 've miss'd our booty;
       Let me die where I am!' And as the fuel
     Of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty
       The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill
     His breath,—he from his swelling throat untied
     A kerchief, crying, 'Give Sal that!'—and died.
     The cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell down
       Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell
     Exactly why it was before him thrown,
       Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.
     Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,
       A thorough varmint, and a real swell,
     Full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,
     His pockets first and then his body riddled.
     Don Juan, having done the best he could
       In all the circumstances of the case,
     As soon as 'Crowner's quest' allow'd, pursued
       His travels to the capital apace;—
     Esteeming it a little hard he should
       In twelve hours' time, and very little space,
     Have been obliged to slay a freeborn native
     In self-defence: this made him meditative.
     He from the world had cut off a great man,
       Who in his time had made heroic bustle.
     Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,
       Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?
     Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow Street's ban)
       On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?
     Who on a lark, with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),
     So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?
     But Tom's no more—and so no more of Tom.
       Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is
     Not long before the most of them go home.
       Hail! Thamis, Hail! Upon thy verge it is
     That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum
       In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,
     Through Kennington and all the other 'tons,'
     Which makes us wish ourselves in town at once;—
     Through Groves, so call'd as being void of trees
       (Like lucus from no light); through prospects named
     Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,
       Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed
     Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,
       With 'To be let' upon their doors proclaim'd;
     Through 'Rows' most modestly call'd 'Paradise,'
     Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;—
     Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl
       Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;
     Here taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'
       There mails fast flying off like a delusion;
     There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl
       In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion
     Slowly distill'd into the glimmering glass
     (For in those days we had not got to gas);—
     Through this, and much, and more, is the approach
       Of travellers to mighty Babylon:
     Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,
       With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.
     I could say more, but do not choose to encroach
       Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The sun
     Had set some time, and night was on the ridge
     Of twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge,—
     That 's rather fine. The gentle sound of Thamis—
       Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream,
     Though hardly heard through multifarious 'damme's'-
       The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,
     The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where fame is
       A spectral resident—whose pallid beam
     In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile—
     Make this a sacred part of Albion's isle.
     The Druids' groves are gone—so much the better:
       Stone-Henge is not—but what the devil is it?-
     But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,
       That madmen may not bite you on a visit;
     The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;
       The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)
     To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;
     But then the Abbey 's worth the whole collection.
     The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,
       Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation
     Like gold as in comparison to dross,
       Match'd with the Continent's illumination,
     Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.
       The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,
     And when they grew so—on their new-found lantern,
     Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.
     A row of gentlemen along the streets
       Suspended may illuminate mankind,
     As also bonfires made of country seats;
       But the old way is best for the purblind:
     The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,
       A sort of ignis fatuus to the mind,
     Which, though 't is certain to perplex and frighten,
     Must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.
     But London 's so well lit, that if Diogenes
       Could recommence to hunt his honest man,
     And found him not amidst the various progenies
       Of this enormous city's spreading span,
     'T were not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his
       Yet undiscover'd treasure. What I can,
     I 've done to find the same throughout life's journey,
     But see the world is only one attorney.
     Over the stones still rattling up Pall Mall,
       Through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner
     As thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd spell
       Of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early dinner
     Admitted a small party as night fell,—
       Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,
     Pursued his path, and drove past some hotels,
     St. James's Palace and St. James's 'Hells.'
     They reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front door
       A tide of well-clad waiters, and around
     The mob stood, and as usual several score
       Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound
     In decent London when the daylight 's o'er;
       Commodious but immoral, they are found
     Useful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.-
     But Juan now is stepping from his carriage
     Into one of the sweetest of hotels,
       Especially for foreigners—and mostly
     For those whom favour or whom fortune swells,
       And cannot find a bill's small items costly.
     There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells
       (The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),
     Until to some conspicuous square they pass,
     And blazon o'er the door their names in brass.
     Juan, whose was a delicate commission,
       Private, though publicly important, bore
     No title to point out with due precision
       The exact affair on which he was sent o'er.
     'T was merely known, that on a secret mission
       A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,
     Young, handsome, and accomplish'd, who was said
     (In whispers) to have turn'd his sovereign's head.
     Some rumour also of some strange adventures
       Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;
     And as romantic heads are pretty painters,
       And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves
     Into the excursive, breaking the indentures
       Of sober reason wheresoe'er it moves,
     He found himself extremely in the fashion,
     Which serves our thinking people for a passion.
     I don't mean that they are passionless, but quite
       The contrary; but then 't is in the head;
     Yet as the consequences are as bright
       As if they acted with the heart instead,
     What after all can signify the site
       Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead
     In safety to the place for which you start,
     What matters if the road be head or heart?
     Juan presented in the proper place,
       To proper placemen, every Russ credential;
     And was received with all the due grimace
       By those who govern in the mood potential,
     Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,
       Thought (what in state affairs is most essential)
     That they as easily might do the youngster,
     As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.
     They err'd, as aged men will do; but by
       And by we 'll talk of that; and if we don't,
     'T will be because our notion is not high
       Of politicians and their double front,
     Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:—
       Now what I love in women is, they won't
     Or can't do otherwise than lie, but do it
     So well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.
     And, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but
       The truth in masquerade; and I defy
     Historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put
       A fact without some leaven of a lie.
     The very shadow of true Truth would shut
       Up annals, revelations, poesy,
     And prophecy—except it should be dated
     Some years before the incidents related.
     Praised be all liars and all lies! Who now
       Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?
     She rings the world's 'Te Deum,' and her brow
       Blushes for those who will not:—but to sigh
     Is idle; let us like most others bow,
       Kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty,
     After the good example of 'Green Erin,'
     Whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.
     Don Juan was presented, and his dress
       And mien excited general admiration—
     I don't know which was more admired or less:
       One monstrous diamond drew much observation,
     Which Catherine in a moment of 'ivresse'
       (In love or brandy's fervent fermentation)
     Bestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;
     And, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.
     Besides the ministers and underlings,
       Who must be courteous to the accredited
     Diplomatists of rather wavering kings,
       Until their royal riddle 's fully read,
     The very clerks,—those somewhat dirty springs
       Of office, or the house of office, fed
     By foul corruption into streams,—even they
     Were hardly rude enough to earn their pay:
     And insolence no doubt is what they are
       Employ'd for, since it is their daily labour,
     In the dear offices of peace or war;
       And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,
     When for a passport, or some other bar
       To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),
     If he found not his spawn of taxborn riches,
     But Juan was received with much 'empressement:'-
       These phrases of refinement I must borrow
     From our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,
       There is a move set down for joy or sorrow
     Not only in mere talking, but the press. Man
       In islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,
     More than on continents—as if the sea
     (See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.
     And yet the British 'Damme' 's rather Attic:
       Your continental oaths are but incontinent,
     And turn on things which no aristocratic
       Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent
     This subject quote; as it would be schismatic
       In politesse, and have a sound affronting in 't:—
     But 'Damme' 's quite ethereal, though too daring—
     Platonic blasphemy, the soul of swearing.
     For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;
       For true or false politeness (and scarce that
     Now) you may cross the blue deep and white foam—
       The first the emblem (rarely though) of what
     You leave behind, the next of much you come
       To meet. However, 't is no time to chat
     On general topics: poems must confine
     Themselves to unity, like this of mine.
     In the great world,—which, being interpreted,
       Meaneth the west or worst end of a city,
     And about twice two thousand people bred
       By no means to be very wise or witty,
     But to sit up while others lie in bed,
       And look down on the universe with pity,—
     Juan, as an inveterate patrician,
     Was well received by persons of condition.
     He was a bachelor, which is a matter
       Of import both to virgin and to bride,
     The former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;
       And (should she not hold fast by love or pride)
     'T is also of some moment to the latter:
       A rib 's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,
     Requires decorum, and is apt to double
     The horrid sin—and what 's still worse, the trouble.
     But Juan was a bachelor—of arts,
       And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had
     An air as sentimental as Mozart's
       Softest of melodies; and could be sad
     Or cheerful, without any 'flaws or starts,'
       Just at the proper time; and though a lad,
     Had seen the world—which is a curious sight,
     And very much unlike what people write.
     Fair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames
       Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;
     For both commodities dwell by the Thames,
       The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,
     Against his heart preferr'd their usual claims,
       Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:
     Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers
     Inquired his income, and if he had brothers.
     The milliners who furnish 'drapery Misses'
       Throughout the season, upon speculation
     Of payment ere the honey-moon's last kisses
       Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,
     Thought such an opportunity as this is,
       Of a rich foreigner's initiation,
     Not to be overlook'd—and gave such credit,
     That future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.
     The Blues, that tender tribe who sigh o'er sonnets,
       And with the pages of the last Review
     Line the interior of their heads or bonnets,
       Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:
     They talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon its
       Late authors ask'd him for a hint or two;
     And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?
     And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?
     Juan, who was a little superficial,
       And not in literature a great Drawcansir,
     Examined by this learned and especial
       Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:
     His duties warlike, loving or official,
       His steady application as a dancer,
     Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,
     Which now he found was blue instead of green.
     However, he replied at hazard, with
       A modest confidence and calm assurance,
     Which lent his learned lucubrations pith,
       And pass'd for arguments of good endurance.
     That prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith
       (Who at sixteen translated 'Hercules Furens'
     Into as furious English), with her best look,
     Set down his sayings in her common-place book.
     Juan knew several languages—as well
       He might—and brought them up with skill, in time
     To save his fame with each accomplish'd belle,
       Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.
     There wanted but this requisite to swell
       His qualities (with them) into sublime:
     Lady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss Maevia Mannish,
     Both long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish.
     However, he did pretty well, and was
       Admitted as an aspirant to all
     The coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,
       At great assemblies or in parties small,
     He saw ten thousand living authors pass,
       That being about their average numeral;
     Also the eighty 'greatest living poets,'
     As every paltry magazine can show its.
     In twice five years the 'greatest living poet,'
       Like to the champion in the fisty ring,
     Is call'd on to support his claim, or show it,
       Although 't is an imaginary thing.
     Even I—albeit I 'm sure I did not know it,
       Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king—
     Was reckon'd a considerable time,
     The grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.
     But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero
       My Leipsic, and my Mount Saint Jean seems Cain:
     'La Belle Alliance' of dunces down at zero,
       Now that the Lion 's fall'n, may rise again:
     But I will fall at least as fell my hero;
       Nor reign at all, or as a monarch reign;
     Or to some lonely isle of gaolers go,
     With turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.
     Sir Walter reign'd before me; Moore and Campbell
       Before and after; but now grown more holy,
     The Muses upon Sion's hill must ramble
       With poets almost clergymen, or wholly;
     And Pegasus hath a psalmodic amble
       Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,
     Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,
     A modern Ancient Pistol—by the hilts?
     Then there 's my gentle Euphues, who, they say,
       Sets up for being a sort of moral me;
     He 'll find it rather difficult some day
       To turn out both, or either, it may be.
     Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;
       And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;
     And that deep-mouth'd Boeotian 'Savage Landor'
     Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.
     John Keats, who was kill'd off by one critique,
       Just as he really promised something great,
     If not intelligible, without Greek
       Contrived to talk about the gods of late,
     Much as they might have been supposed to speak.
       Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;
     'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,
     Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.
     The list grows long of live and dead pretenders
       To that which none will gain—or none will know
     The conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders
       His last award, will have the long grass grow
     Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.
       If I might augur, I should rate but low
     Their chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty
     Mock tyrants, when Rome's annals wax'd but dirty.
     This is the literary lower empire,
       Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;—
     A 'dreadful trade,' like his who 'gathers samphire,'
       The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,
     With the same feelings as you 'd coax a vampire.
       Now, were I once at home, and in good satire,
     I 'd try conclusions with those Janizaries,
     And show them what an intellectual war is.
     I think I know a trick or two, would turn
       Their flanks;—but it is hardly worth my while
     With such small gear to give myself concern:
       Indeed I 've not the necessary bile;
     My natural temper 's really aught but stern,
       And even my Muse's worst reproof 's a smile;
     And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,
     And glides away, assured she never hurts ye.
     My Juan, whom I left in deadly peril
       Amongst live poets and blue ladies, past
     With some small profit through that field so sterile,
       Being tired in time, and, neither least nor last,
     Left it before he had been treated very ill;
       And henceforth found himself more gaily class'd
     Amongst the higher spirits of the day,
     The sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.
     His morns he pass'd in business—which, dissected,
       Was like all business a laborious nothing
     That leads to lassitude, the most infected
       And Centaur Nessus garb of mortal clothing,
     And on our sofas makes us lie dejected,
       And talk in tender horrors of our loathing
     All kinds of toil, save for our country's good—
     Which grows no better, though 't is time it should.
     His afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons,
       Lounging and boxing; and the twilight hour
     In riding round those vegetable puncheons
       Call'd 'Parks,' where there is neither fruit nor flower
     Enough to gratify a bee's slight munchings;
       But after all it is the only 'bower'
     (In Moore's phrase), where the fashionable fair
     Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.
     Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!
       Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar
     Through street and square fast flashing chariots hurl'd
       Like harness'd meteors; then along the floor
     Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl'd;
       Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,
     Which opens to the thousand happy few
     An earthly paradise of 'Or Molu.'
     There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink
       With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz,
     The only dance which teaches girls to think,
       Makes one in love even with its very faults.
     Saloon, room, hall, o'erflow beyond their brink,
       And long the latest of arrivals halts,
     'Midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to climb,
     And gain an inch of staircase at a time.
     Thrice happy he who, after a survey
       Of the good company, can win a corner,
     A door that's in or boudoir out of the way,
       Where he may fix himself like small 'Jack Horner,'
     And let the Babel round run as it may,
       And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,
     Or an approver, or a mere spectator,
     Yawning a little as the night grows later.
     But this won't do, save by and by; and he
       Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,
     Must steer with care through all that glittering sea
       Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where
     He deems it is his proper place to be;
       Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,
     Or proudlier prancing with mercurial skill
     Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille.
     Or, if he dance not, but hath higher views
       Upon an heiress or his neighbour's bride,
     Let him take care that that which he pursues
       Is not at once too palpably descried.
     Full many an eager gentleman oft rues
       His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,
     Amongst a people famous for reflection,
     Who like to play the fool with circumspection.
     But, if you can contrive, get next at supper;
       Or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle:—
     O, ye ambrosial moments! always upper
       In mind, a sort of sentimental bogle,
     Which sits for ever upon memory's crupper,
       The ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! Ill
     Can tender souls relate the rise and fall
     Of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.
     But these precautionary hints can touch
       Only the common run, who must pursue,
     And watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much
       Or little overturns; and not the few
     Or many (for the number's sometimes such)
       Whom a good mien, especially if new,
     Or fame, or name, for wit, war, sense, or nonsense,
     Permits whate'er they please, or did not long since.
     Our hero, as a hero, young and handsome,
       Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,
     Like other slaves of course must pay his ransom,
       Before he can escape from so much danger
     As will environ a conspicuous man. Some
       Talk about poetry, and 'rack and manger,'
     And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;—
     I wish they knew the life of a young noble.
     They are young, but know not youth—it is anticipated;
       Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;
     Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;
       Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a Jew;
     Both senates see their nightly votes participated
       Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew;
     And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,
     The family vault receives another lord.
     'Where is the world?' cries Young, at eighty—'Where
       The world in which a man was born? 'Alas!
     Where is the world of eight years past? 'T was there—
       I look for it—'t is gone, a globe of glass!
     Crack'd, shiver'd, vanish'd, scarcely gazed on, ere
       A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.
     Statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings,
     And dandies, all are gone on the wind's wings.
     Where is Napoleon the Grand? God knows.
       Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell:
     Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those
       Who bound the bar or senate in their spell?
     Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?
       And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?
     Where are those martyr'd saints the Five per Cents?
     And where—oh, where the devil are the rents?
     Where 's Brummel? Dish'd. Where 's Long Pole Wellesley? Diddled.
       Where 's Whitbread? Romilly? Where 's George the Third?
     Where is his will? (That 's not so soon unriddled.)
       And where is 'Fum' the Fourth, our 'royal bird?'
     Gone down, it seems, to Scotland to be fiddled
       Unto by Sawney's violin, we have heard:
     'Caw me, caw thee'—for six months hath been hatching
     This scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.
     Where is Lord This? And where my Lady That?
       The Honourable Mistresses and Misses?
     Some laid aside like an old Opera hat,
       Married, unmarried, and remarried (this is
     An evolution oft performed of late).
       Where are the Dublin shouts—and London hisses?
     Where are the Grenvilles? Turn'd as usual. Where
     My friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were.
     Where are the Lady Carolines and Franceses?
       Divorced or doing thereanent. Ye annals
     So brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is,—
       Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels
     Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies
       Of fashion,—say what streams now fill those channels?
     Some die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,
     Because the times have hardly left them one tenant.
     Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,
       Have taken up at length with younger brothers:
     Some heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks:
       Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers;
     Others have lost their fresh and fairy looks:
       In short, the list of alterations bothers.
     There 's little strange in this, but something strange is
     The unusual quickness of these common changes.
     Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven
       I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to
     The humblest individual under heaven,
       Than might suffice a moderate century through.
     I knew that nought was lasting, but now even
       Change grows too changeable, without being new:
     Nought 's permanent among the human race,
     Except the Whigs not getting into place.
     I have seen Napoleon, who seem'd quite a Jupiter,
       Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke
     (No matter which) turn politician stupider,
       If that can well be, than his wooden look.
     But it is time that I should hoist my 'blue Peter,'
       And sail for a new theme:—I have seen—and shook
     To see it—the king hiss'd, and then caress'd;
     But don't pretend to settle which was best.
     I have seen the Landholders without a rap—
       I have seen Joanna Southcote—I have seen—
     The House of Commons turn'd to a tax-trap—
       I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen—
     I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap—
       I have seen a Congress doing all that 's mean—
     I have seen some nations like o'erloaded asses
     Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.
     I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and
       Interminable—not eternal—speakers—
     I have seen the funds at war with house and land—
       I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers—
     I have seen the people ridden o'er like sand
       By slaves on horseback—I have seen malt liquors
     Exchanged for 'thin potations' by John Bull—
     I have seen john half detect himself a fool.-
     But 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'
       To-morrow sees another race as gay
     And transient, and devour'd by the same harpy.
       'Life 's a poor player,'—then 'play out the play,
     Ye villains!' above all keep a sharp eye
       Much less on what you do than what you say:
     Be hypocritical, be cautious, be
     Not what you seem, but always what you see.
     But how shall I relate in other cantos
       Of what befell our hero in the land,
     Which 't is the common cry and lie to vaunt as
       A moral country? But I hold my hand—
     For I disdain to write an Atalantis;
       But 't is as well at once to understand,
     You are not a moral people, and you know it
     Without the aid of too sincere a poet.
     What Juan saw and underwent shall be
       My topic, with of course the due restriction
     Which is required by proper courtesy;
       And recollect the work is only fiction,
     And that I sing of neither mine nor me,
       Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,
     Will hint allusions never meant. Ne'er doubt
     This—when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.
     Whether he married with the third or fourth
       Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,
     Or whether with some virgin of more worth
       (I mean in Fortune's matrimonial bounties)
     He took to regularly peopling Earth,
       Of which your lawful awful wedlock fount is,—
     Or whether he was taken in for damages,
     For being too excursive in his homages,—
     Is yet within the unread events of time.
       Thus far, go forth, thou lay, which I will back
     Against the same given quantity of rhyme,
       For being as much the subject of attack
     As ever yet was any work sublime,
       By those who love to say that white is black.
     So much the better!—I may stand alone,
     But would not change my free thoughts for a throne.
Canto 12
CANTO THE TWELTH.
     Of all the barbarous middle ages, that
       Which is most barbarous is the middle age
     Of man; it is—I really scarce know what;
       But when we hover between fool and sage,
     And don't know justly what we would be at—
       A period something like a printed page,
     Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair
     Grows grizzled, and we are not what we were;—
     Too old for youth,—too young, at thirty-five,
       To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,—
     I wonder people should be left alive;
       But since they are, that epoch is a bore:
     Love lingers still, although 't were late to wive;
       And as for other love, the illusion 's o'er;
     And money, that most pure imagination,
     Gleams only through the dawn of its creation.
     O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?
       Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;
     Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable
       Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.
     Ye who but see the saving man at table,
       And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,
     And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,
     Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.
     Love or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;
       Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;
     But making money, slowly first, then quicker,
       And adding still a little through each cross
     (Which will come over things), beats love or liquor,
       The gamester's counter, or the statesman's dross.
     O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,
     Which makes bank credit like a bank of vapour.
     Who hold the balance of the world? Who reign
       O'er congress, whether royalist or liberal?
     Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?
       (That make old Europe's journals squeak and gibber all.)
     Who keep the world, both old and new, in pain
       Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?
     The shade of Buonaparte's noble daring?-
     Jew Rothschild, and his fellow-Christian, Baring.
     Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,
       Are the true lords of Europe. Every loan
     Is not a merely speculative hit,
       But seats a nation or upsets a throne.
     Republics also get involved a bit;
       Columbia's stock hath holders not unknown
     On 'Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,
     Must get itself discounted by a Jew.
     Why call the miser miserable? as
       I said before: the frugal life is his,
     Which in a saint or cynic ever was
       The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss
     Canonization for the self-same cause,
       And wherefore blame gaunt wealth's austerities?
     Because, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;—
     Then there 's more merit in his self-denial.
     He is your only poet;—passion, pure
       And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,
     Possess'd, the ore, of which mere hopes allure
       Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays
     Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure;
       On him the diamond pours its brilliant blaze,
     While the mild emerald's beam shades down the dies
     Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.
     The lands on either side are his; the ship
       From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads
     For him the fragrant produce of each trip;
       Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,
     And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;
       His very cellars might be kings' abodes;
     While he, despising every sensual call,
     Commands—the intellectual lord of all.
     Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,
       To build a college, or to found a race,
     A hospital, a church,—and leave behind
       Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:
     Perhaps he fain would liberate mankind
       Even with the very ore which makes them base;
     Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,
     Or revel in the joys of calculation.
     But whether all, or each, or none of these
       May be the hoarder's principle of action,
     The fool will call such mania a disease:—
       What is his own? Go—look at each transaction,
     Wars, revels, loves—do these bring men more ease
       Than the mere plodding through each 'vulgar fraction'?
     Or do they benefit mankind? Lean miser!
     Let spendthrifts' heirs enquire of yours—who 's wiser?
     How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests
       Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins
     (Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests
       Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,
     But) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests
       Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,
     Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp:—
     Yes! ready money is Aladdin's lamp.
     'Love rules the camp, the court, the grove,'—'for love
       Is heaven, and heaven is love:'—so sings the bard;
     Which it were rather difficult to prove
       (A thing with poetry in general hard).
     Perhaps there may be something in 'the grove,'
       At least it rhymes to 'love;' but I 'm prepared
     To doubt (no less than landlords of their rental)
     If 'courts' and 'camps' be quite so sentimental.
     But if Love don't, Cash does, and Cash alone:
       Cash rules the grove, and fells it too besides;
     Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;
       Without cash, Malthus tells you—'take no brides.'
     So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own
       High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:
     And as for Heaven 'Heaven being Love,' why not say honey
     Is wax? Heaven is not Love, 't is Matrimony.
     Is not all love prohibited whatever,
       Excepting marriage? which is love, no doubt,
     After a sort; but somehow people never
       With the same thought the two words have help'd out:
     Love may exist with marriage, and should ever,
       And marriage also may exist without;
     But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,
     And ought to go by quite another name.
     Now if the 'court,' and 'camp,' and 'grove,' be not
       Recruited all with constant married men,
     Who never coveted their neighbour's lot,
       I say that line 's a lapsus of the pen;—
     Strange too in my 'buon camerado' Scott,
       So celebrated for his morals, when
     My Jeffrey held him up as an example
     To me;—of whom these morals are a sample.
     Well, if I don't succeed, I have succeeded,
       And that 's enough; succeeded in my youth,
     The only time when much success is needed:
       And my success produced what I, in sooth,
     Cared most about; it need not now be pleaded—
       Whate'er it was, 't was mine; I 've paid, in truth,
     Of late the penalty of such success,
     But have not learn'd to wish it any less.
     That suit in Chancery,—which some persons plead
       In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,
     In the faith of their procreative creed,
       Baptize posterity, or future clay,—
     To me seems but a dubious kind of reed
       To lean on for support in any way;
     Since odds are that posterity will know
     No more of them, than they of her, I trow.
     Why, I 'm posterity—and so are you;
       And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.
     Were every memory written down all true,
       The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder'd;
     Even Plutarch's Lives have but pick'd out a few,
       And 'gainst those few your annalists have thunder'd;
     And Mitford in the nineteenth century
     Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.
     Good people all, of every degree,
       Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,
     In this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be
       As serious as if I had for inditers
     Malthus and Wilberforce:—the last set free
       The Negroes and is worth a million fighters;
     While Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,
     And Malthus does the thing 'gainst which he writes.
     I 'm serious—so are all men upon paper;
       And why should I not form my speculation,
     And hold up to the sun my little taper?
       Mankind just now seem wrapt in mediation
     On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;
       While sages write against all procreation,
     Unless a man can calculate his means
     Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.
     That 's noble! That 's romantic! For my part,
       I think that 'Philo-genitiveness' is
     (Now here 's a word quite after my own heart,
       Though there 's a shorter a good deal than this,
     If that politeness set it not apart;
       But I 'm resolved to say nought that 's amiss)—
     I say, methinks that 'Philo-genitiveness'
     Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.
     And now to business.—O my gentle Juan,
       Thou art in London—in that pleasant place,
     Where every kind of mischief 's daily brewing,
       Which can await warm youth in its wild race.
     'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;
       Thou art no novice in the headlong chase
     Of early life; but this is a new land,
     Which foreigners can never understand.
     What with a small diversity of climate,
       Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,
     I could send forth my mandate like a primate
       Upon the rest of Europe's social state;
     But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,
       Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.
     All countries have their 'Lions,' but in the
     There is but one superb menagerie.
     But I am sick of politics. Begin,
       'Paulo Majora.' Juan, undecided
     Amongst the paths of being 'taken in,'
       Above the ice had like a skater glided:
     When tired of play, he flirted without sin
       With some of those fair creatures who have prided
     Themselves on innocent tantalisation,
     And hate all vice except its reputation.
     But these are few, and in the end they make
       Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows
     That even the purest people may mistake
       Their way through virtue's primrose paths of snows;
     And then men stare, as if a new ass spake
       To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows
     Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)
     With the kind world's amen—'Who would have thought it?'
     The little Leila, with her orient eyes,
       And taciturn Asiatic disposition
     (Which saw all western things with small surprise,
       To the surprise of people of condition,
     Who think that novelties are butterflies
       To be pursued as food for inanition),
     Her charming figure and romantic history
     Became a kind of fashionable mystery.
     The women much divided—as is usual
       Amongst the sex in little things or great.
     Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all—
       I have always liked you better than I state:
     Since I 've grown moral, still I must accuse you all
       Of being apt to talk at a great rate;
     And now there was a general sensation
     Amongst you, about Leila's education.
     In one point only were you settled—and
       You had reason; 't was that a young child of grace,
     As beautiful as her own native land,
       And far away, the last bud of her race,
     Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command
       Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,
     Would be much better taught beneath the eye
     Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.
     So first there was a generous emulation,
       And then there was a general competition,
     To undertake the orphan's education.
       As Juan was a person of condition,
     It had been an affront on this occasion
       To talk of a subscription or petition;
     But sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages,
     Whose tale belongs to 'Hallam's Middle Ages,'
     And one or two sad, separate wives, without
       A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough—
     Begg'd to bring up the little girl and 'out,'-
       For that 's the phrase that settles all things now,
     Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,
       And all her points as thorough-bred to show:
     And I assure you, that like virgin honey
     Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).
     How all the needy honourable misters,
       Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,
     The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters
       (Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy
     At making matches, where ''t is gold that glisters,'
       Than their he relatives), like flies o'er candy
     Buzz round 'the Fortune' with their busy battery,
     To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!
     Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;
       Nay, married dames will now and then discover
     Such pure disinterestedness of passion,
       I 've known them court an heiress for their lover.
     'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,
       Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet 's 'Dover!'
     While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,
     Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.
     Some are soon bagg'd, and some reject three dozen.
       'T is fine to see them scattering refusals
     And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin
       (Friends of the party), who begin accusals,
     Such as—'Unless Miss (Blank) meant to have chosen
       Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals
     To his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,
     Look yes last night, and yet say no to-day?
     'Why?—Why?—Besides, Fred really was attach'd;
       'T was not her fortune—he has enough without:
     The time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd
       So good an opportunity, no doubt:—
     But the old marchioness some plan had hatch'd,
       As I 'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:
     And after all poor Frederick may do better—
     Pray did you see her answer to his letter?'
     Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets
       Are spurn'd in turn, until her turn arrives,
     After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets
       Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;
     And when at last the pretty creature gets
       Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,
     It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected
     To find how very badly she selected.
     For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,
       Worn out with importunity; or fall
     (But here perhaps the instances are fewer)
       To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.
     A hazy widower turn'd of forty 's sure
       (If 't is not vain examples to recall)
     To draw a high prize: now, howe'er he got her, I
     See nought more strange in this than t' other lottery.
     I, for my part (one 'modern instance' more,
       'True, 't is a pity—pity 't is, 't is true'),
     Was chosen from out an amatory score,
       Albeit my years were less discreet than few;
     But though I also had reform'd before
       Those became one who soon were to be two,
     I 'll not gainsay the generous public's voice,
     That the young lady made a monstrous choice.
     O, pardon my digression—or at least
       Peruse! 'T is always with a moral end
     That I dissert, like grace before a feast:
       For like an aged aunt, or tiresome friend,
     A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,
       My Muse by exhortation means to mend
     All people, at all times, and in most places,
     Which puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.
     But now I 'm going to be immoral; now
       I mean to show things really as they are,
     Not as they ought to be: for I avow,
       That till we see what 's what in fact, we 're far
     From much improvement with that virtuous plough
       Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar
     Upon the black loam long manured by Vice,
     Only to keep its corn at the old price.
     But first of little Leila we 'll dispose;
       For like a day-dawn she was young and pure,
     Or like the old comparison of snows,
       Which are more pure than pleasant to be sure.
     Like many people everybody knows,
       Don Juan was delighted to secure
     A goodly guardian for his infant charge,
     Who might not profit much by being at large.
     Besides, he had found out he was no tutor
       (I wish that others would find out the same);
     And rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,
       For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:
     So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor
       To make his little wild Asiatic tame,
     Consulting 'the Society for Vice
     Suppression,' Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.
     Olden she was—but had been very young;
       Virtuous she was—and had been, I believe;
     Although the world has such an evil tongue
       That—but my chaster ear will not receive
     An echo of a syllable that 's wrong:
       In fact, there 's nothing makes me so much grieve,
     As that abominable tittle-tattle,
     Which is the cud eschew'd by human cattle.
     Moreover I 've remark'd (and I was once
       A slight observer in a modest way),
     And so may every one except a dunce,
       That ladies in their youth a little gay,
     Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense
       Of the sad consequence of going astray,
     Are wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe
     Which the mere passionless can never know.
     While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue
       By railing at the unknown and envied passion,
     Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,
       Or, what 's still worse, to put you out of fashion,—
     The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,
       Entreating you to pause before you dash on;
     Expounding and illustrating the riddle
     Of epic Love's beginning, end, and middle.
     Now whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,
       As better knowing why they should be so,
     I think you 'll find from many a family picture,
       That daughters of such mothers as may know
     The world by experience rather than by lecture,
       Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show
     Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,
     Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.
     I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talk'd about—
       As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?
     But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk'd about;
       She merely was deem'd amiable and witty,
     And several of her best bon-mots were hawk'd about:
       Then she was given to charity and pity,
     And pass'd (at least the latter years of life)
     For being a most exemplary wife.
     High in high circles, gentle in her own,
       She was the mild reprover of the young,
     Whenever—which means every day—they 'd shown
       An awkward inclination to go wrong.
     The quantity of good she did 's unknown,
       Or at the least would lengthen out my song:
     In brief, the little orphan of the East
     Had raised an interest in her, which increased.
     Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,
       Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,
     A little spoil'd, but not so altogether;
       Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,
     And how he had been toss'd, he scarce knew whither:
       Though this might ruin others, it did not him,
     At least entirely—for he had seen too many
     Changes in youth, to be surprised at any.
     And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;
       For when they happen at a riper age,
     People are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,
       And wonder Providence is not more sage.
     Adversity is the first path to truth:
       He who hath proved war, storm, or woman's rage,
     Whether his winters be eighteen or eighty,
     Hath won the experience which is deem'd so weighty.
     How far it profits is another matter.-
       Our hero gladly saw his little charge
     Safe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter
       Being long married, and thus set at large,
     Had left all the accomplishments she taught her
       To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,
     To the next comer; or—as it will tell
     More Muse-like—like to Cytherea's shell.
     I call such things transmission; for there is
       A floating balance of accomplishment
     Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,
       According as their minds or backs are bent.
     Some waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss
       Of metaphysics; others are content
     With music; the most moderate shine as wits;
     While others have a genius turn'd for fits.
     But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords,
       Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,
     May be the baits for gentlemen or lords
       With regular descent, in these our days,
     The last year to the new transfers its hoards;
       New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise
     Of 'elegant' et caetera, in fresh batches—
     All matchless creatures, and yet bent on matches.
     But now I will begin my poem. 'T is
       Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,
     That from the first of Cantos up to this
       I 've not begun what we have to go through.
     These first twelve books are merely flourishes,
       Preludios, trying just a string or two
     Upon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;
     And when so, you shall have the overture.
     My Muses do not care a pinch of rosin
       About what 's call'd success, or not succeeding:
     Such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;
       'T is a 'great moral lesson' they are reading.
     I thought, at setting off, about two dozen
       Cantos would do; but at Apollo's pleading,
     If that my Pegasus should not be founder'd,
     I think to canter gently through a hundred.
     Don Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,
       Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,
     Although the highest: but as swords have hilts
       By which their power of mischief is increased,
     When man in battle or in quarrel tilts,
       Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,
     Must still obey the high—which is their handle,
     Their moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.
     He had many friends who had many wives, and was
       Well look'd upon by both, to that extent
     Of friendship which you may accept or pass,
       It does nor good nor harm being merely meant
     To keep the wheels going of the higher class,
       And draw them nightly when a ticket 's sent:
     And what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,
     For the first season such a life scarce palls.
     A young unmarried man, with a good name
       And fortune, has an awkward part to play;
     For good society is but a game,
       'The royal game of Goose,' as I may say,
     Where every body has some separate aim,
       An end to answer, or a plan to lay—
     The single ladies wishing to be double,
     The married ones to save the virgins trouble.
     I don't mean this as general, but particular
       Examples may be found of such pursuits:
     Though several also keep their perpendicular
       Like poplars, with good principles for roots;
     Yet many have a method more reticular—
       'Fishers for men,' like sirens with soft lutes:
     For talk six times with the same single lady,
     And you may get the wedding dresses ready.
     Perhaps you 'll have a letter from the mother,
       To say her daughter's feelings are trepann'd;
     Perhaps you 'll have a visit from the brother,
       All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand
     What 'your intentions are?'—One way or other
       It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:
     And between pity for her case and yours,
     You 'll add to Matrimony's list of cures.
     I 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,
       And some of them high names: I have also known
     Young men who—though they hated to discuss
       Pretensions which they never dream'd to have shown—
     Yet neither frighten'd by a female fuss,
       Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,
     And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,
     In happier plight than if they form'd a pair.
     There 's also nightly, to the uninitiated,
       A peril—not indeed like love or marriage,
     But not the less for this to be depreciated:
       It is—I meant and mean not to disparage
     The show of virtue even in the vitiated—
       It adds an outward grace unto their carriage—
     But to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,
     'Couleur de rose,' who 's neither white nor scarlet.
     Such is your cold coquette, who can't say 'No,'
       And won't say 'Yes,' and keeps you on and off-ing
     On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow—
       Then sees your heart wreck'd, with an inward scoffing.
     This works a world of sentimental woe,
       And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;
     But yet is merely innocent flirtation,
     Not quite adultery, but adulteration.
     'Ye gods, I grow a talker!' Let us prate.
       The next of perils, though I place it sternest,
     Is when, without regard to 'church or state,'
       A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.
     Abroad, such things decide few women's fate—
       (Such, early traveller! is the truth thou learnest)—
     But in old England, when a young bride errs,
     Poor thing! Eve's was a trifling case to hers.
     For 't is a low, newspaper, humdrum, lawsuit
       Country, where a young couple of the same ages
     Can't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.
       Then there's the vulgar trick of those d——d damages! !
     A verdict—grievous foe to those who cause it!-
       Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;
     Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,
     And evidences which regale all readers.
     But they who blunder thus are raw beginners;
       A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy
     Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,
       The loveliest oligarchs of our gynocracy;
     You may see such at all the balls and dinners,
       Among the proudest of our aristocracy,
     So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste—
     And all by having tact as well as taste.
     Juan, who did not stand in the predicament
       Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;
     For he was sick—no, 't was not the word sick I meant—
       But he had seen so much love before,
     That he was not in heart so very weak;—I meant
       But thus much, and no sneer against the shore
     Of white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings,
     Tithes, taxes, duns, and doors with double knockings.
     But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,
       Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risk'd for Passion,
     And Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,
       Into a country where 't is half a fashion,
     Seem'd to him half commercial, half pedantic,
       Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:
     Besides (alas! his taste—forgive and pity!)
     At first he did not think the women pretty.
     I say at first—for he found out at last,
       But by degrees, that they were fairer far
     Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast
       Beneath the influence of the eastern star.
     A further proof we should not judge in haste;
       Yet inexperience could not be his bar
     To taste:—the truth is, if men would confess,
     That novelties please less than they impress.
     Though travell'd, I have never had the luck to
       Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,
     To that impracticable place, Timbuctoo,
       Where Geography finds no one to oblige her
     With such a chart as may be safely stuck to—
       For Europe ploughs in Afric like 'bos piger:'
     But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there
     No doubt I should be told that black is fair.
     It is. I will not swear that black is white;
       But I suspect in fact that white is black,
     And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.
       Ask a blind man, the best judge. You 'll attack
     Perhaps this new position—but I 'm right;
       Or if I 'm wrong, I 'll not be ta'en aback:—
     He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark
     Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.
     But I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,
       That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same
     Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,
       Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;
     And this reflection brings me to plain physics,
       And to the beauties of a foreign dame,
     Compared with those of our pure pearls of price,
     Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.
     Or say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose
       Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;—
     Not that there 's not a quantity of those
       Who have a due respect for their own wishes.
     Like Russians rushing from hot baths to snows
       Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:
     They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,
     As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.
     But this has nought to do with their outsides.
       I said that Juan did not think them pretty
     At the first blush; for a fair Briton hides
       Half her attractions—probably from pity—
     And rather calmly into the heart glides,
       Than storms it as a foe would take a city;
     But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)
     She keeps it for you like a true ally.
     She cannot step as does an Arab barb,
       Or Andalusian girl from mass returning,
     Nor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,
       Nor in her eye Ausonia's glance is burning;
     Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb—
       le those bravuras (which I still am learning
     To like, though I have been seven years in Italy,
     And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);—
     She cannot do these things, nor one or two
       Others, in that off-hand and dashing style
     Which takes so much—to give the devil his due;
       Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,
     Nor settles all things in one interview
       (A thing approved as saving time and toil);—
     But though the soil may give you time and trouble,
     Well cultivated, it will render double.
     And if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'
       It is a very serious thing indeed:
     Nine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,
       Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,
     The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,
       Or wish to make a rival's bosom bleed:
     But the tenth instance will be a tornado,
     For there 's no saying what they will or may do.
     The reason 's obvious; if there 's an eclat,
       They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;
     And when the delicacies of the law
       Have fill'd their papers with their comments various,
     Society, that china without flaw
       (The hypocrite!), will banish them like Marius,
     To sit amidst the ruins of their guilt:
     For Fame 's a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.
     Perhaps this is as it should be;—it is
       A comment on the Gospel's 'Sin no more,
     And be thy sins forgiven:'—but upon this
       I leave the saints to settle their own score.
     Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,
       An erring woman finds an opener door
     For her return to Virtue—as they cal
     That lady, who should be at home to all.
     For me, I leave the matter where I find it,
       Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads
     People some ten times less in fact to mind it,
       And care but for discoveries and not deeds.
     And as for chastity, you 'll never bind it
       By all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads,
     But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,
     By rendering desperate those who had else repented.
     But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd
       Upon the moral lessons of mankind:
     Besides, he had not seen of several hundred
       A lady altogether to his mind.
     A little 'blase'—'t is not to be wonder'd
       At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:
     And though not vainer from his past success,
     No doubt his sensibilities were less.
     He also had been busy seeing sights—
       The Parliament and all the other houses;
     Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,
       To hear debates whose thunder roused (not rouses)
     The world to gaze upon those northern lights
       Which flash'd as far as where the musk-bull browses;
     He had also stood at times behind the throne—
     But Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.
     He saw, however, at the closing session,
       That noble sight, when really free the nation,
     A king in constitutional possession
       Of such a throne as is the proudest station,
     Though despots know it not—till the progression
       Of freedom shall complete their education.
     'T is not mere splendour makes the show august
     To eye or heart—it is the people's trust.
     There, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)
       A Prince, the prince of princes at the time,
     With fascination in his very bow,
       And full of promise, as the spring of prime.
     Though royalty was written on his brow,
       He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,
     Of being, without alloy of fop or beau,
     A finish'd gentleman from top to toe.
     And Juan was received, as hath been said,
       Into the best society: and there
     Occurr'd what often happens, I 'm afraid,
       However disciplined and debonnaire:—
     The talent and good humour he display'd,
       Besides the mark'd distinction of his air,
     Exposed him, as was natural, to temptation,
     Even though himself avoided the occasion.
     But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,
       Is not to be put hastily together;
     And as my object is morality
       (Whatever people say), I don't know whether
     I 'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,
       But harrow up his feelings till they wither,
     And hew out a huge monument of pathos,
     As Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.
     Here the twelfth Canto of our introduction
       Ends. When the body of the book 's begun,
     You 'll find it of a different construction
       From what some people say 't will be when done:
     The plan at present 's simply in concoction,
       I can't oblige you, reader, to read on;
     That 's your affair, not mine: a real spirit
     Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.
     And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,
       Remember, reader! you have had before
     The worst of tempests and the best of battles
       That e'er were brew'd from elements or gore,
     Besides the most sublime of—Heaven knows what else:
       An usurer could scarce expect much more—
     But my best canto, save one on astronomy,
     Will turn upon 'political economy.'
     That is your present theme for popularity:
       Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,
     It grows an act of patriotic charity,
       To show the people the best way to break.
     My plan (but I, if but for singularity,
       Reserve it) will be very sure to take.
     Meantime, read all the national debt-sinkers,
     And tell me what you think of your great thinkers.
Canto 13
CANTO THE THIRTEENTH.
     I now mean to be serious;—it is time,
       Since laughter now-a-days is deem'd too serious.
     A jest at Vice by Virtue 's call'd a crime,
       And critically held as deleterious:
     Besides, the sad 's a source of the sublime,
       Although when long a little apt to weary us;
     And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,
     As an old temple dwindled to a column.
     The Lady Adeline Amundeville
       ('Tis an old Norman name, and to be found
     In pedigrees, by those who wander still
       Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)
     Was high-born, wealthy by her father's will,
       And beauteous, even where beauties most abound,
     In Britain—which of course true patriots find
     The goodliest soil of body and of mind.
     I 'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;
       I 'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best:
     An eye 's an eye, and whether black or blue,
       Is no great matter, so 't is in request,
     'T is nonsense to dispute about a hue—
       The kindest may be taken as a test.
     The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,
     Till thirty, should perceive there 's a plain woman.
     And after that serene and somewhat dull
       Epoch, that awkward corner turn'd for days
     More quiet, when our moon 's no more at full,
       We may presume to criticise or praise;
     Because indifference begins to lull
       Our passions, and we walk in wisdom's ways;
     Also because the figure and the face
     Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.
     I know that some would fain postpone this era,
       Reluctant as all placemen to resign
     Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,
       For they have pass'd life's equinoctial line:
     But then they have their claret and Madeira
       To irrigate the dryness of decline;
     And county meetings, and the parliament,
     And debt, and what not, for their solace sent.
     And is there not religion, and reform,
       Peace, war, the taxes, and what 's call'd the 'Nation'?
     The struggle to be pilots in a storm?
       The landed and the monied speculation?
     The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,
       Instead of love, that mere hallucination?
     Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;
     Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.
     Rough Johnson, the great moralist, profess'd,
       Right honestly, 'he liked an honest hater!'-
     The only truth that yet has been confest
       Within these latest thousand years or later.
     Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:—
       For my part, I am but a mere spectator,
     And gaze where'er the palace or the hovel is,
     Much in the mode of Goethe's Mephistopheles;
     But neither love nor hate in much excess;
       Though 't was not once so. If I sneer sometimes,
     It is because I cannot well do less,
       And now and then it also suits my rhymes.
     I should be very willing to redress
       Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,
     Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale
     Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.
     Of all tales 't is the saddest—and more sad,
       Because it makes us smile: his hero 's right,
     And still pursues the right;—to curb the bad
       His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight
     His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!
       But his adventures form a sorry sight;
     A sorrier still is the great moral taught
     By that real epic unto all who have thought.
     Redressing injury, revenging wrong,
       To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;
     Opposing singly the united strong,
       From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:—
     Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,
       Be for mere fancy's sport a theme creative,
     A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!
     And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?
     Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;
       A single laugh demolish'd the right arm
     Of his own country;—seldom since that day
       Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,
     The world gave ground before her bright array;
       And therefore have his volumes done such harm,
     That all their glory, as a composition,
     Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.
     I 'm 'at my old lunes'—digression, and forget
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville;
     The fair most fatal Juan ever met,
       Although she was not evil nor meant ill;
     But Destiny and Passion spread the net
       (Fate is a good excuse for our own will),
     And caught them;—what do they not catch, methinks?
     But I 'm not OEdipus, and life 's a Sphinx.
     I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare
       To venture a solution: 'Davus sum!'
     And now I will proceed upon the pair.
       Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay world's hum,
     Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that 's fair;
       Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.
     The last 's a miracle, and such was reckon'd,
     And since that time there has not been a second.
     Chaste was she, to detraction's desperation,
       And wedded unto one she had loved well—
     A man known in the councils of the nation,
       Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,
     Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,
       Proud of himself and her: the world could tell
     Nought against either, and both seem'd secure—
     She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.
     It chanced some diplomatical relations,
       Arising out of business, often brought
     Himself and Juan in their mutual stations
       Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught
     By specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,
       And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,
     And form'd a basis of esteem, which ends
     In making men what courtesy calls friends.
     And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as
       Reserve and pride could make him, and full slow
     In judging men—when once his judgment was
       Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,
     Had all the pertinacity pride has,
       Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,
     And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,
     Because its own good pleasure hath decided.
     His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,
       Though oft well founded, which confirm'd but more
     His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians
       And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.
     His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,
       Of common likings, which make some deplore
     What they should laugh at—the mere ague still
     Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.
     ''T is not in mortals to command success:
       But do you more, Sempronius—don't deserve it,'
     And take my word, you won't have any less.
       Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;
     Give gently way, when there 's too great a press;
       And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,
     For, like a racer, or a boxer training,
     'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.
     Lord Henry also liked to be superior,
       As most men do, the little or the great;
     The very lowest find out an inferior,
       At least they think so, to exert their state
     Upon: for there are very few things wearier
       Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,
     Which mortals generously would divide,
     By bidding others carry while they ride.
     In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,
       O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;
     In years he had the advantage of time's sequel;
       And, as he thought, in country much the same—
     Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,
       At which all modern nations vainly aim;
     And the Lord Henry was a great debater,
     So that few members kept the house up later.
     These were advantages: and then he thought—
       It was his foible, but by no means sinister—
     That few or none more than himself had caught
       Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:
     He liked to teach that which he had been taught,
       And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;
     And reconciled all qualities which grace man,
     Always a patriot, and sometimes a placeman.
     He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;
       He almost honour'd him for his docility;
     Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,
       Or contradicted but with proud humility.
     He knew the world, and would not see depravity
       In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,
     If that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop—
     For then they are very difficult to stop.
     And then he talk'd with him about Madrid,
       Constantinople, and such distant places;
     Where people always did as they were bid,
       Or did what they should not with foreign graces.
     Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid
       Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;
     And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,
     Could back a horse, as despots ride a Russian.
     And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,
       And diplomatic dinners, or at other—
     For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,
       As in freemasonry a higher brother.
     Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;
       His manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;
     And all men like to show their hospitality
     To him whose breeding matches with his quality.
     At Blank-Blank Square;—for we will break no squares
       By naming streets: since men are so censorious,
     And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,
       Reaping allusions private and inglorious,
     Where none were dreamt of, unto love's affairs,
       Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,
     That therefore do I previously declare,
     Lord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.
     Also there bin another pious reason
       For making squares and streets anonymous;
     Which is, that there is scarce a single season
       Which doth not shake some very splendid house
     With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason—
       A topic scandal doth delight to rouse:
     Such I might stumble over unawares,
     Unless I knew the very chastest squares.
     'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,
       A place where peccadillos are unknown;
     But I have motives, whether wise or silly,
       For letting that pure sanctuary alone.
     Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I
       Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,
     A vestal shrine of innocence of heart:
       Such are—but I have lost the London Chart.
     At Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,
       Was Juan a recherche, welcome guest,
     As many other noble scions were;
       And some who had but talent for their crest;
     Or wealth, which is a passport every where;
       Or even mere fashion, which indeed 's the best
     Recommendation; and to be well drest
     Will very often supersede the rest.
     And since 'there 's safety in a multitude
       Of counsellors,' as Solomon has said,
     Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;—
       Indeed we see the daily proof display'd
     In senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,
       Where'er collective wisdom can parade,
     Which is the only cause that we can guess
     Of Britain's present wealth and happiness;—
     But as 'there 's safety' grafted in the number
       'Of counsellors' for men, thus for the sex
     A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;
       Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex—
     Variety itself will more encumber.
       'Midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks;
     And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's
     Self-love, there 's safety in a crowd of coxcombs.
     But Adeline had not the least occasion
       For such a shield, which leaves but little merit
     To virtue proper, or good education.
       Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,
     Which judged mankind at their due estimation;
       And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:
     Secure of admiration, its impression
     Was faint, as of an every-day possession.
     To all she was polite without parade;
       To some she show'd attention of that kind
     Which flatters, but is flattery convey'd
       In such a sort as cannot leave behind
     A trace unworthy either wife or maid;—
       A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,
     To those who were, or pass'd for meritorious,
     Just to console sad glory for being glorious;
     Which is in all respects, save now and then,
       A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze
     Upon the shades of those distinguish'd men
       Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,
     The praise of persecution; gaze again
       On the most favour'd; and amidst the blaze
     Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,
     What can ye recognise?—a gilded cloud.
     There also was of course in Adeline
       That calm patrician polish in the address,
     Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line
       Of any thing which nature would express;
     Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,—
       At least his manner suffers not to guess
     That any thing he views can greatly please.
     Perhaps we have borrow'd this from the Chinese—
     Perhaps from Horace: his 'Nil admirari'
       Was what he call'd the 'Art of Happiness;'
     An art on which the artists greatly vary,
       And have not yet attain'd to much success.
     However, 't is expedient to be wary:
       Indifference certes don't produce distress;
     And rash enthusiasm in good society
     Were nothing but a moral inebriety.
     But Adeline was not indifferent: for
       (Now for a common-place!) beneath the snow,
     As a volcano holds the lava more
       Within—et caetera. Shall I go on?—No!
     I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,
       So let the often-used volcano go.
     Poor thing! How frequently, by me and others,
     It hath been stirr'd up till its smoke quite smothers!
     I 'll have another figure in a trice:—
       What say you to a bottle of champagne?
     Frozen into a very vinous ice,
       Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,
     Yet in the very centre, past all price,
       About a liquid glassful will remain;
     And this is stronger than the strongest grape
     Could e'er express in its expanded shape:
     'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;
       And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre
     A hidden nectar under a cold presence.
       And such are many—though I only meant her
     From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,
       On which the Muse has always sought to enter.
     And your cold people are beyond all price,
     When once you have broken their confounded ice.
     But after all they are a North-West Passage
       Unto the glowing India of the soul;
     And as the good ships sent upon that message
       Have not exactly ascertain'd the Pole
     (Though Parry's efforts look a lucky presage),
       Thus gentlemen may run upon a shoal;
     For if the Pole 's not open, but all frost
     (A chance still), 't is a voyage or vessel lost.
     And young beginners may as well commence
       With quiet cruising o'er the ocean woman;
     While those who are not beginners should have sense
       Enough to make for port, ere time shall summon
     With his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,
       The dreary 'Fuimus' of all things human,
     Must be declined, while life's thin thread 's spun out
     Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.
     But heaven must be diverted; its diversion
       Is sometimes truculent—but never mind:
     The world upon the whole is worth the assertion
       (If but for comfort) that all things are kind:
     And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,
       Of the two principles, but leaves behind
     As many doubts as any other doctrine
     Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.
     The English winter—ending in July,
       To recommence in August—now was done.
     'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;
       On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.
     But for post-horses who finds sympathy?
       Man's pity 's for himself, or for his son,
     Always premising that said son at college
     Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge.
     The London winter 's ended in July—
       Sometimes a little later. I don't err
     In this: whatever other blunders lie
       Upon my shoulders, here I must aver
     My Muse a glass of weatherology;
       For parliament is our barometer:
     Let radicals its other acts attack,
     Its sessions form our only almanack.
     When its quicksilver 's down at zero,—lo
       Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!
     Wheels whirl from Carlton palace to Soho,
       And happiest they who horses can engage;
     The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row
       Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;
     And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,
     Sigh—as the postboys fasten on the traces.
     They and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left
       To the Greek kalends of another session.
     Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,
       What hope remains? Of hope the full possession,
     Or generous draft, conceded as a gift,
       At a long date—till they can get a fresh one—
     Hawk'd about at a discount, small or large;
     Also the solace of an overcharge.
     But these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,
       Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.
     Away! away! 'Fresh horses!' are the word,
       And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;
     The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;
       The postboys have no reason to disparage
     Their fee; but ere the water'd wheels may hiss hence,
     The ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.
     'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey—
       That gentleman of lords and gentlemen;
     Also my lady's gentlewoman, tricky,
       Trick'd out, but modest more than poet's pen
     Can paint,—'Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!'
       (Excuse a foreign slipslop now and then,
     If but to show I 've travell'd; and what 's travel,
     Unless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)
     The London winter and the country summer
       Were well nigh over. 'T is perhaps a pity,
     When nature wears the gown that doth become her,
       To lose those best months in a sweaty city,
     And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,
       Listening debates not very wise or witty,
     Ere patriots their true country can remember;—
     But there 's no shooting (save grouse) till September.
     I 've done with my tirade. The world was gone;
       The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,
     Were vanish'd to be what they call alone—
       That is, with thirty servants for parade,
     As many guests, or more; before whom groan
       As many covers, duly, daily, laid.
     Let none accuse Old England's hospitality—
     Its quantity is but condensed to quality.
     Lord Henry and the Lady Adeline
       Departed like the rest of their compeers,
     The peerage, to a mansion very fine;
       The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.
     None than themselves could boast a longer line,
       Where time through heroes and through beauties steers;
     And oaks as olden as their pedigree
     Told of their sires, a tomb in every tree.
     A paragraph in every paper told
       Of their departure: such is modern fame:
     'T is pity that it takes no farther hold
       Than an advertisement, or much the same;
     When, ere the ink be dry, the sound grows cold.
       The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim—
     'Departure, for his country seat, to-day,
     Lord H. Amundeville and Lady A.
     'We understand the splendid host intends
       To entertain, this autumn, a select
     And numerous party of his noble friends;
       'Midst whom we have heard, from sources quite correct,
       With many more by rank and fashion deck'd;
     Also a foreigner of high condition,
     The envoy of the secret Russian mission.'
     And thus we see—who doubts the Morning Post?
       (Whose articles are like the 'Thirty-nine,'
     Which those most swear to who believe them most)—
       Our gay Russ Spaniard was ordain'd to shine,
     Deck'd by the rays reflected from his host,
       With those who, Pope says, 'greatly daring dine.'
     'T is odd, but true,—last war the News abounded
     More with these dinners than the kill'd or wounded;—
     As thus: 'On Thursday there was a grand dinner;
       Present, Lords A. B. C.'—Earls, dukes, by name
     Announced with no less pomp than victory's winner:
       Then underneath, and in the very same
     Column; date, 'Falmouth. There has lately been here
       The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to fame,
     Whose loss in the late action we regret:
     The vacancies are fill'd up—see Gazette.'
     To Norman Abbey whirl'd the noble pair,—
       An old, old monastery once, and now
     Still older mansion; of a rich and rare
       Mix'd Gothic, such as artists all allow
     Few specimens yet left us can compare
       Withal: it lies perhaps a little low,
     Because the monks preferr'd a hill behind,
     To shelter their devotion from the wind.
     It stood embosom'd in a happy valley,
       Crown'd by high woodlands, where the Druid oak
     Stood like Caractacus in act to rally
       His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunderstroke;
     And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally
       The dappled foresters—as day awoke,
     The branching stag swept down with all his herd,
     To quaff a brook which murmur'd like a bird.
     Before the mansion lay a lucid lake,
       Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed
     By a river, which its soften'd way did take
       In currents through the calmer water spread
     Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake
       And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:
     The woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood
     With their green faces fix'd upon the flood.
     Its outlet dash'd into a deep cascade,
       Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,
     Its shriller echoes—like an infant made
       Quiet—sank into softer ripples, gliding
     Into a rivulet; and thus allay'd,
       Pursued its course, now gleaming, and now hiding
     Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,
     According as the skies their shadows threw.
     A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile
       (While yet the church was Rome's) stood half apart
     In a grand arch, which once screen'd many an aisle.
       These last had disappear'd—a loss to art:
     The first yet frown'd superbly o'er the soil,
       And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,
     Which mourn'd the power of time's or tempest's march,
     In gazing on that venerable arch.
     Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,
       Twelve saints had once stood sanctified in stone;
     But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,
       But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,
     When each house was a fortalice, as tell
       The annals of full many a line undone,—
     The gallant cavaliers, who fought in vain
     For those who knew not to resign or reign.
     But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,
       The Virgin Mother of the God-born Child,
     With her Son in her blessed arms, look'd round,
       Spared by some chance when all beside was spoil'd;
     She made the earth below seem holy ground.
       This may be superstition, weak or wild,
     But even the faintest relics of a shrine
     Of any worship wake some thoughts divine.
     A mighty window, hollow in the centre,
       Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,
     Through which the deepen'd glories once could enter,
       Streaming from off the sun like seraph's wings,
     Now yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,
       The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings
     The owl his anthem, where the silenced quire
     Lie with their hallelujahs quench'd like fire.
     But in the noontide of the moon, and when
       The wind is winged from one point of heaven,
     There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then
       Is musical—a dying accent driven
     Through the huge arch, which soars and sinks again.
       Some deem it but the distant echo given
     Back to the night wind by the waterfall,
     And harmonised by the old choral wall:
     Others, that some original shape, or form
       Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power
     (Though less than that of Memnon's statue, warm
       In Egypt's rays, to harp at a fix'd hour)
     To this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.
       Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;
     The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such
     The fact:—I 've heard it—once perhaps too much.
     Amidst the court a Gothic fountain play'd,
       Symmetrical, but deck'd with carvings quaint—
     Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,
       And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:
     The spring gush'd through grim mouths of granite made,
       And sparkled into basins, where it spent
     Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,
     Like man's vain glory, and his vainer troubles.
     The mansion's self was vast and venerable,
       With more of the monastic than has been
     Elsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,
       The cells, too, and refectory, I ween:
     An exquisite small chapel had been able,
       Still unimpair'd, to decorate the scene;
     The rest had been reform'd, replaced, or sunk,
     And spoke more of the baron than the monk.
     Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, join'd
       By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,
     Might shock a connoisseur; but when combined,
       Form'd a whole which, irregular in parts,
     Yet left a grand impression on the mind,
       At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:
     We gaze upon a giant for his stature,
     Nor judge at first if all be true to nature.
     Steel barons, molten the next generation
       To silken rows of gay and garter'd earls,
     Glanced from the walls in goodly preservation;
       And Lady Marys blooming into girls,
     With fair long locks, had also kept their station;
       And countesses mature in robes and pearls:
     Also some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,
     Whose drapery hints we may admire them freely.
     Judges in very formidable ermine
       Were there, with brows that did not much invite
     The accused to think their lordships would determine
       His cause by leaning much from might to right:
     Bishops, who had not left a single sermon:
       Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,
     As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)
     Of the 'Star Chamber' than of 'Habeas Corpus.'
     Generals, some all in armour, of the old
       And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;
     Others in wigs of Marlborough's martial fold,
       Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:
     Lordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:
       Nimrods, whose canvass scarce contain'd the steed;
     And here and there some stern high patriot stood,
     Who could not get the place for which he sued.
     But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,
       Fatigued with these hereditary glories,
     There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,
       Or wilder group of savage Salvatore's;
     Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone
       In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories
     Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted
     His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.
     Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;
       There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,
     Or gloomy Caravaggio's gloomier stain
       Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:—
     But, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,
       Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:
     His bell-mouth'd goblet makes me feel quite Danish
     Or Dutch with thirst—What, ho! a flask of Rhenish.
     O reader! if that thou canst read,—and know,
       'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,
     To constitute a reader; there must go
       Virtues of which both you and I have need;—
     Firstly, begin with the beginning (though
       That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed;
     Thirdly, commence not with the end—or, sinning
     In this sort, end at least with the beginning.
     But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,
       While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,
     Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,
       Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.
     That poets were so from their earliest date,
       By Homer's 'Catalogue of ships' is clear;
     But a mere modern must be moderate—
     I spare you then the furniture and plate.
     The mellow autumn came, and with it came
       The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.
     The corn is cut, the manor full of game;
       The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats
     In russet jacket:—lynx-like is his aim;
       Full grows his bag, and wonderful his feats.
     Ah, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!
     And ah, ye poachers!—'T is no sport for peasants.
     An English autumn, though it hath no vines,
       Blushing with Bacchant coronals along
     The paths, o'er which the far festoon entwines
       The red grape in the sunny lands of song,
     Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;
       The claret light, and the Madeira strong.
     If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,
     The very best of vineyards is the cellar.
     Then, if she hath not that serene decline
       Which makes the southern autumn's day appear
     As if 't would to a second spring resign
       The season, rather than to winter drear,
     Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,—
       The sea-coal fires the 'earliest of the year;'
     Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,
     As what is lost in green is gain'd in yellow.
     And for the effeminate villeggiatura—
       Rife with more horns than hounds—she hath the chase,
     So animated that it might allure
       Saint from his beads to join the jocund race;
     Even Nimrod's self might leave the plains of Dura,
       And wear the Melton jacket for a space:
     If she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame
     Preserve of bores, who ought to be made game.
     The noble guests, assembled at the Abbey,
       Consisted of—we give the sex the pas—
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;
       The Ladies Scilly, Busey;—Miss Eclat,
     Miss Bombazeen, Miss Mackstay, Miss O'Tabby,
       And Mrs. Rabbi, the rich banker's squaw;
     Also the honourable Mrs. Sleep,
     Who look'd a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:
     With other Countesses of Blank—but rank;
       At once the 'lie' and the 'elite' of crowds;
     Who pass like water filter'd in a tank,
       All purged and pious from their native clouds;
     Or paper turn'd to money by the Bank:
       No matter how or why, the passport shrouds
     The 'passee' and the past; for good society
     Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,—
     That is, up to a certain point; which point
       Forms the most difficult in punctuation.
     Appearances appear to form the joint
       On which it hinges in a higher station;
     And so that no explosion cry 'Aroint
       Thee, witch!' or each Medea has her Jason;
     Or (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)
     'Omne tulit punctum, quae miscuit utile dulci.'
     I can't exactly trace their rule of right,
       Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.
     I 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite
       By the mere combination of a coterie;
     Also a so-so matron boldly fight
       Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,
     And shine the very Siria of the spheres,
     Escaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.
     I have seen more than I 'll say:—but we will see
       How our villeggiatura will get on.
     The party might consist of thirty-three
       Of highest caste—the Brahmins of the ton.
     I have named a few, not foremost in degree,
       But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.
     By way of sprinkling, scatter'd amongst these,
     There also were some Irish absentees.
     There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,
       Who limits all his battles to the bar
     And senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,
       He shows more appetite for words than war.
     There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly
       Come out and glimmer'd as a six weeks' star.
     There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;
     And Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.
     There was the Duke of Dash, who was a—duke,
       'Ay, every inch a' duke; there were twelve peers
     Like Charlemagne's—and all such peers in look
       And intellect, that neither eyes nor ears
     For commoners had ever them mistook.
       There were the six Miss Rawbolds—pretty dears!
     All song and sentiment; whose hearts were set
     Less on a convent than a coronet.
     There were four Honourable Misters, whose
       Honour was more before their names than after;
     There was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,
       Whom France and Fortune lately deign'd to waft here,
     Whose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;
       But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,
     Because—such was his magic power to please—
     The dice seem'd charm'd, too, with his repartees.
     There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,
       Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;
     Angle, the soi-disant mathematician;
       Sir Henry Silvercup, the great race-winner.
     There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,
       Who did not hate so much the sin as sinner;
     And Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet,
     Good at all things, but better at a bet.
     There was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;
       And General Fireface, famous in the field,
     A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,
       Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he kill'd.
     There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,
       In his grave office so completely skill'd,
     That when a culprit came far condemnation,
     He had his judge's joke for consolation.
     Good company 's a chess-board—there are kings,
       Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the world 's a game;
     Save that the puppets pull at their own strings,
       Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.
     My Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,
       Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,
     Alighting rarely:—were she but a hornet,
     Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.
     I had forgotten—but must not forget—
       An orator, the latest of the session,
     Who had deliver'd well a very set
       Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression
     Upon debate: the papers echoed yet
       With his debut, which made a strong impression,
     And rank'd with what is every day display'd—
     'The best first speech that ever yet was made.'
     Proud of his 'Hear hims!' proud, too, of his vote
       And lost virginity of oratory,
     Proud of his learning (just enough to quote),
       He revell'd in his Ciceronian glory:
     With memory excellent to get by rote,
       With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,
     Graced with some merit, and with more effrontery,
     'His country's pride,' he came down to the country.
     There also were two wits by acclamation,
       Longbow from Ireland, Strongbow from the Tweed,
     Both lawyers and both men of education;
       But Strongbow's wit was of more polish'd breed:
     Longbow was rich in an imagination
       As beautiful and bounding as a steed,
     But sometimes stumbling over a potato,—
     While Strongbow's best things might have come from Cato.
     Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;
       But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,
     With which the winds of heaven can claim accord,
       And make a music, whether flat or sharp.
     Of Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:
       At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:
     Both wits—one born so, and the other bred—
     This by his heart, his rival by his head.
     If all these seem a heterogeneous mas
       To be assembled at a country seat,
     Yet think, a specimen of every class
       Is better than a humdrum tete-a-tete.
     The days of Comedy are gone, alas!
       When Congreve's fool could vie with Moliere's bete:
     Society is smooth'd to that excess,
     That manners hardly differ more than dress.
     Our ridicules are kept in the back-ground—
       Ridiculous enough, but also dull;
     Professions, too, are no more to be found
       Professional; and there is nought to cull
     Of folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,
       They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.
     Society is now one polish'd horde,
     Form'd of two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.
     But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning
       The scanty but right-well thresh'd ears of truth;
     And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,
       You may be Boaz, and I—modest Ruth.
     Farther I 'd quote, but Scripture intervening
       Forbids. Its great impression in my youth
     Was made by Mrs. Adams, where she cries,
     'That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies.'
     But what we can we glean in this vile age
       Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.
     I must not quite omit the talking sage,
       Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,
     Who, in his common-place book, had a page
       Prepared each morn for evenings. 'List, oh, list!'-
     'Alas, poor ghost!'—What unexpected woes
     Await those who have studied their bon-mots!
     Firstly, they must allure the conversation
       By many windings to their clever clinch;
     And secondly, must let slip no occasion,
       Nor bate (abate) their hearers of an inch,
     But take an ell—and make a great sensation,
       If possible; and thirdly, never flinch
     When some smart talker puts them to the test,
     But seize the last word, which no doubt 's the best.
     Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;
       The party we have touch'd on were the guests:
     Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts
       To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.
     I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,
       Albeit all human history attests
     That happiness for man—the hungry sinner!-
     Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.
     Witness the lands which 'flow'd with milk and honey,'
       Held out unto the hungry Israelites;
     To this we have added since, the love of money,
       The only sort of pleasure which requites.
     Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;
       We tire of mistresses and parasites;
     But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?
     When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!
     The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,
       Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport—
     The first thing boys like after play and fruit;
       The middle-aged to make the day more short;
     For ennui is a growth of English root,
       Though nameless in our language:—we retort
     The fact for words, and let the French translate
     That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.
     The elderly walk'd through the library,
       And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,
     Or saunter'd through the gardens piteously,
       And made upon the hot-house several strictures,
     Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,
       Or on the morning papers read their lectures,
     Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,
     Longing at sixty for the hour of six.
     But none were 'gene:' the great hour of union
       Was rung by dinner's knell; till then all were
     Masters of their own time—or in communion,
       Or solitary, as they chose to bear
     The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.
       Each rose up at his own, and had to spare
     What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast
     When, where, and how he chose for that repast.
     The ladies—some rouged, some a little pale—
       Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,
     Or walk'd; if foul, they read, or told a tale,
       Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;
     Discuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,
       And settled bonnets by the newest code,
     Or cramm'd twelve sheets into one little letter,
     To make each correspondent a new debtor.
     For some had absent lovers, all had friends.
       The earth has nothing like a she epistle,
     And hardly heaven—because it never ends.
       I love the mystery of a female missal,
     Which, like a creed, ne'er says all it intends,
       But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,
     When he allured poor Dolon:—you had better
     Take care what you reply to such a letter.
     Then there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;—
       Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;—
     Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,
       And the hard frost destroy'd the scenting days:
     And angling, too, that solitary vice,
       Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says;
     The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet
     Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.
     With evening came the banquet and the wine;
       The conversazione; the duet,
     Attuned by voices more or less divine
       (My heart or head aches with the memory yet).
     The four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;
       But the two youngest loved more to be set
     Down to the harp—because to music's charms
     They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.
     Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,
       For then the gentlemen were rather tired)
     Display'd some sylph-like figures in its maze;
       Then there was small-talk ready when required;
     Flirtation—but decorous; the mere praise
       Of charms that should or should not be admired.
     The hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,
     And then retreated soberly—at ten.
     The politicians, in a nook apart,
       Discuss'd the world, and settled all the spheres;
     The wits watch'd every loophole for their art,
       To introduce a bon-mot head and ears;
     Small is the rest of those who would be smart,
       A moment's good thing may have cost them years
     Before they find an hour to introduce it;
     And then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.
     But all was gentle and aristocratic
       In this our party; polish'd, smooth, and cold,
     As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.
       There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;
     And our Sophias are not so emphatic,
       But fair as then, or fairer to behold.
     We have no accomplish'd blackguards, like Tom Jones,
     But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.
     They separated at an early hour;
       That is, ere midnight—which is London's noon:
     But in the country ladies seek their bower
       A little earlier than the waning moon.
     Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower—
       May the rose call back its true colour soon!
     Good hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,
     And lower the price of rouge—at least some winters.
Canto 14
CANTO THE FOURTEENTH.
     If from great nature's or our own abyss
       Of thought we could but snatch a certainty,
     Perhaps mankind might find the path they miss—
       But then 't would spoil much good philosophy.
     One system eats another up, and this
       Much as old Saturn ate his progeny;
     For when his pious consort gave him stones
     In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.
     But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,
       And eats her parents, albeit the digestion
     Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,
       After due search, your faith to any question?
     Look back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast
       You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.
     Nothing more true than not to trust your senses;
     And yet what are your other evidences?
     For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,
       Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,
     Except perhaps that you were born to die?
       And both may after all turn out untrue.
     An age may come, Font of Eternity,
       When nothing shall be either old or new.
     Death, so call'd, is a thing which makes men weep,
     And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.
     A sleep without dreams, after a rough day
       Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet
     How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!
       The very Suicide that pays his debt
     At once without instalments (an old way
       Of paying debts, which creditors regret)
     Lets out impatiently his rushing breath,
     Less from disgust of life than dread of death.
     'T is round him, near him, here, there, every where;
       And there 's a courage which grows out of fear,
     Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare
       The worst to know it:—when the mountains rear
     Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there
       You look down o'er the precipice, and drear
     The gulf of rock yawns,—you can't gaze a minute
     Without an awful wish to plunge within it.
     'T is true, you don't—but, pale and struck with terror,
       Retire: but look into your past impression!
     And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror
       Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,
     The lurking bias, be it truth or error,
       To the unknown; a secret prepossession,
     To plunge with all your fears—but where? You know not,
     And that's the reason why you do—or do not.
     But what 's this to the purpose? you will say.
       Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,
     For which my sole excuse is—'t is my way;
       Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion
     I write what 's uppermost, without delay:
       This narrative is not meant for narration,
     But a mere airy and fantastic basis,
     To build up common things with common places.
     You know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,
       'Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;'
     And such a straw, borne on by human breath,
       Is poesy, according as the mind glows;
     A paper kite which flies 'twixt life and death,
       A shadow which the onward soul behind throws:
     And mine 's a bubble, not blown up for praise,
     But just to play with, as an infant plays.
     The world is all before me—or behind;
       For I have seen a portion of that same,
     And quite enough for me to keep in mind;—
       Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,
     To the great pleasure of our friends, mankind,
       Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;
     For I was rather famous in my time,
     Until I fairly knock'd it up with rhyme.
     I have brought this world about my ears, and eke
       The other; that 's to say, the clergy, who
     Upon my head have bid their thunders break
       In pious libels by no means a few.
     And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,
       Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.
     In youth I wrote because my mind was full,
     And now because I feel it growing dull.
     But 'why then publish?'—There are no rewards
       Of fame or profit when the world grows weary.
     I ask in turn,—Why do you play at cards?
       Why drink? Why read?—To make some hour less dreary.
     It occupies me to turn back regards
       On what I 've seen or ponder'd, sad or cheery;
     And what I write I cast upon the stream,
     To swim or sink—I have had at least my dream.
     I think that were I certain of success,
       I hardly could compose another line:
     So long I 've battled either more or less,
       That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.
     This feeling 't is not easy to express,
       And yet 't is not affected, I opine.
     In play, there are two pleasures for your choosing—
     The one is winning, and the other losing.
     Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:
       She gathers a repertory of facts,
     Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,
       But mostly sings of human things and acts—
     And that 's one cause she meets with contradiction;
       For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;
     And were her object only what 's call'd glory,
     With more ease too she 'd tell a different story.
     Love, war, a tempest—surely there 's variety;
       Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;
     A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;
       A slight glance thrown on men of every station.
     If you have nought else, here 's at least satiety
       Both in performance and in preparation;
     And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,
     Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.
     The portion of this world which I at present
       Have taken up to fill the following sermon,
     Is one of which there 's no description recent.
       The reason why is easy to determine:
     Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,
       There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,
     A dull and family likeness through all ages,
     Of no great promise for poetic pages.
     With much to excite, there 's little to exalt;
       Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;
     A sort of varnish over every fault;
       A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;
     Factitious passions, wit without much salt,
       A want of that true nature which sublimes
     Whate'er it shows with truth; a smooth monotony
     Of character, in those at least who have got any.
     Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,
       They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;
     But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,
       And they must be or seem what they were: still
     Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;
       But when of the first sight you have had your fill,
     It palls—at least it did so upon me,
     This paradise of pleasure and ennui.
     When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,
       Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;
     With dandies dined; heard senators declaiming;
       Seen beauties brought to market by the score,
     Sad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming;
       There 's little left but to be bored or bore.
     Witness those 'ci-devant jeunes hommes' who stem
     The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.
     'T is said—indeed a general complaint—
       That no one has succeeded in describing
     The monde, exactly as they ought to paint:
       Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing
     The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,
       To furnish matter for their moral gibing;
     And that their books have but one style in common—
     My lady's prattle, filter'd through her woman.
     But this can't well be true, just now; for writers
       Are grown of the beau monde a part potential:
     I 've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,
       Especially when young, for that 's essential.
     Why do their sketches fail them as inditers
       Of what they deem themselves most consequential,
     The real portrait of the highest tribe?
     'T is that, in fact, there 's little to describe.
     'Haud ignara loquor;' these are Nugae, 'quarum
       Pars parva fui,' but still art and part.
     Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,
       A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,
     Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,
       For reasons which I choose to keep apart.
     'Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit—'
     Which means that vulgar people must not share it.
     And therefore what I throw off is ideal—
       Lower'd, leaven'd, like a history of freemasons;
     Which bears the same relation to the real,
       As Captain Parry's voyage may do to Jason's.
     The grand arcanum 's not for men to see all;
       My music has some mystic diapasons;
     And there is much which could not be appreciated
     In any manner by the uninitiated.
     Alas! worlds fall—and woman, since she fell'd
       The world (as, since that history less polite
     Than true, hath been a creed so strictly held)
       Has not yet given up the practice quite.
     Poor thing of usages! coerced, compell'd,
       Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,
     Condemn'd to child-bed, as men for their sins
     Have shaving too entail'd upon their chins,—
     A daily plague, which in the aggregate
       May average on the whole with parturition.
     But as to women, who can penetrate
       The real sufferings of their she condition?
     Man's very sympathy with their estate
       Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.
     Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,
     But form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.
     All this were very well, and can't be better;
       But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,
     So many troubles from her birth beset her,
       Such small distinction between friends and foes,
     The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,
       That—but ask any woman if she'd choose
     (Take her at thirty, that is) to have been
     Female or male? a schoolboy or a queen?
     'Petticoat influence' is a great reproach,
       Which even those who obey would fain be thought
     To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;
       But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,
     By various joltings of life's hackney coach,
       I for one venerate a petticoat—
     A garment of a mystical sublimity,
     No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.
     Much I respect, and much I have adored,
       In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,
     Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,
       And more attracts by all it doth conceal—
     A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,
       A loving letter with a mystic seal,
     A cure for grief—for what can ever rankle
     Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?
     And when upon a silent, sullen day,
       With a sirocco, for example, blowing,
     When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,
       And sulkily the river's ripple 's flowing,
     And the sky shows that very ancient gray,
       The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,—
     'T is pleasant, if then any thing is pleasant,
     To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.
     We left our heroes and our heroines
       In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,
     Quite independent of the Zodiac's signs,
       Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,
     Because the sun, and stars, and aught that shines,
       Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,
     Are there oft dull and dreary as a dun—
     Whether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.
     An in-door life is less poetical;
       And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,
     With which I could not brew a pastoral.
       But be it as it may, a bard must meet
     All difficulties, whether great or small,
       To spoil his undertaking or complete,
     And work away like spirit upon matter,
     Embarrass'd somewhat both with fire and water.
     Juan—in this respect, at least, like saints—
       Was all things unto people of all sorts,
     And lived contentedly, without complaints,
       In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts—
     Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,
       And mingling modestly in toils or sports.
     He likewise could be most things to all women,
     Without the coxcombry of certain she men.
     A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;
       'T is also subject to the double danger
     Of tumbling first, and having in exchange
       Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:
     But Juan had been early taught to range
       The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,
     So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,
     Knew that he had a rider on his back.
     And now in this new field, with some applause,
       He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,
     And never craned, and made but few 'faux pas,'
       And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.
     He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws
       Of hunting—for the sagest youth is frail;
     Rode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,
     And once o'er several country gentlemen.
     But on the whole, to general admiration
       He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires
     Marvell'd at merit of another nation;
       The boors cried 'Dang it? who 'd have thought it?'—Sires,
     The Nestors of the sporting generation,
       Swore praises, and recall'd their former fires;
     The huntsman's self relented to a grin,
     And rated him almost a whipper-in.
     Such were his trophies—not of spear and shield,
       But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;
     Yet I must own,—although in this I yield
       To patriot sympathy a Briton's blushes,—
     He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,
       Who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,
     And what not, though he rode beyond all price,
     Ask'd next day, 'If men ever hunted twice?'
     He also had a quality uncommon
       To early risers after a long chase,
     Who wake in winter ere the cock can summon
       December's drowsy day to his dull race,—
     A quality agreeable to woman,
       When her soft, liquid words run on apace,
     Who likes a listener, whether saint or sinner,—
     He did not fall asleep just after dinner;
     But, light and airy, stood on the alert,
       And shone in the best part of dialogue,
     By humouring always what they might assert,
       And listening to the topics most in vogue;
     Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;
       And smiling but in secret—cunning rogue!
     He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;—
     In short, there never was a better hearer.
     And then he danced;—all foreigners excel
       The serious Angles in the eloquence
     Of pantomime;—he danced, I say, right well,
       With emphasis, and also with good sense—
     A thing in footing indispensable;
       He danced without theatrical pretence,
     Not like a ballet-master in the van
     Of his drill'd nymphs, but like a gentleman.
     Chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,
       And elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;
     Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,
       And rather held in than put forth his vigour;
     And then he had an ear for music's sound,
       Which might defy a crotchet critic's rigour.
     Such classic pas—sans flaws—set off our hero,
     He glanced like a personified Bolero;
     Or, like a flying Hour before Aurora,
       In Guido's famous fresco which alone
     Is worth a tour to Rome, although no more a
       Remnant were there of the old world's sole throne.
     The 'tout ensemble' of his movements wore a
       Grace of the soft ideal, seldom shown,
     And ne'er to be described; for to the dolour
     Of bards and prosers, words are void of colour.
     No marvel then he was a favourite;
       A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;
     A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;
       At least he kept his vanity retired.
     Such was his tact, he could alike delight
       The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'
     Began to treat him with some small 'agacerie.'
     She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,
       Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated
     For several winters in the grand, grand monde.
       I 'd rather not say what might be related
     Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;
       Besides there might be falsehood in what 's stated:
     Her late performance had been a dead set
     At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.
     This noble personage began to look
       A little black upon this new flirtation;
     But such small licences must lovers brook,
       Mere freedoms of the female corporation.
     Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!
       'T will but precipitate a situation
     Extremely disagreeable, but common
     To calculators when they count on woman.
     The circle smiled, then whisper'd, and then sneer'd;
       The Misses bridled, and the matrons frown'd;
     Some hoped things might not turn out as they fear'd;
       Some would not deem such women could be found;
     Some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;
       Some look'd perplex'd, and others look'd profound;
     And several pitied with sincere regret
     Poor Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.
     But what is odd, none ever named the duke,
       Who, one might think, was something in the affair;
     True, he was absent, and, 't was rumour'd, took
       But small concern about the when, or where,
     Or what his consort did: if he could brook
       Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:
     Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,
     Which never meets, and therefore can't fall out.
     But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!
       Fired with an abstract love of virtue, she,
     My Dian of the Ephesians, Lady Adeline,
       Began to think the duchess' conduct free;
     Regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,
       And waxing chiller in her courtesy,
     Look'd grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,
     For which most friends reserve their sensibility.
     There 's nought in this bad world like sympathy:
       'T is so becoming to the soul and face,
     Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,
       And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.
     Without a friend, what were humanity,
       To hunt our errors up with a good grace?
     Consoling us with—'Would you had thought twice!
     Ah, if you had but follow'd my advice!'
     O job! you had two friends: one 's quite enough,
       Especially when we are ill at ease;
     They are but bad pilots when the weather 's rough,
       Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.
     Let no man grumble when his friends fall off,
       As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:
     When your affairs come round, one way or t' other,
     Go to the coffee-house, and take another.
     But this is not my maxim: had it been,
       Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not—
     I would not be a tortoise in his screen
       Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not.
     'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen
       That which humanity may bear, or bear not:
     'T will teach discernment to the sensitive,
     And not to pour their ocean in a sieve.
     Of all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,
       Sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,
     Is that portentous phrase, 'I told you so,'
       Utter'd by friends, those prophets of the past,
     Who, 'stead of saying what you now should do,
       Own they foresaw that you would fall at last,
     And solace your slight lapse 'gainst 'bonos mores,'
     With a long memorandum of old stories.
     The Lady Adeline's serene severity
       Was not confined to feeling for her friend,
     Whose fame she rather doubted with posterity,
       Unless her habits should begin to mend:
     But Juan also shared in her austerity,
       But mix'd with pity, pure as e'er was penn'd:
     His inexperience moved her gentle ruth,
     And (as her junior by six weeks) his youth.
     These forty days' advantage of her years—
       And hers were those which can face calculation,
     Boldly referring to the list of peers
       And noble births, nor dread the enumeration—
     Gave her a right to have maternal fears
       For a young gentleman's fit education,
     Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,
     In female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.
     This may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty—
       Say seven-and-twenty; for I never knew
     The strictest in chronology and virtue
       Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.
     O Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty
       With rust, should surely cease to hack and hew.
     Reset it; shave more smoothly, also slower,
     If but to keep thy credit as a mower.
     But Adeline was far from that ripe age,
       Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:
     'T was rather her experience made her sage,
       For she had seen the world and stood its test,
     As I have said in—I forget what page;
       My Muse despises reference, as you have guess'd
     By this time;—but strike six from seven-and-twenty,
     And you will find her sum of years in plenty.
     At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,
       She put all coronets into commotion:
     At seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted
       With the new Venus of their brilliant ocean:
     At eighteen, though below her feet still panted
       A hecatomb of suitors with devotion,
     She had consented to create again
     That Adam, call'd 'The happiest of men.'
     Since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,
       Admired, adored; but also so correct,
     That she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,
       Without the apparel of being circumspect:
     They could not even glean the slightest splinters
       From off the marble, which had no defect.
     She had also snatch'd a moment since her marriage
     To bear a son and heir—and one miscarriage.
     Fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,
       Those little glitterers of the London night;
     But none of these possess'd a sting to wound her—
       She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.
     Perhaps she wish'd an aspirant profounder;
       But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;
     And whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify
     A woman, so she 's good, what does it signify?
     I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle
       Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,
     Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,
       Especially with politics on hand;
     I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,
       Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;
     I hate it, as I hate an argument,
     A laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.'
     'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,
       They are so much intertwisted with the earth;
     So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,
       I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.
     To trace all actions to their secret springs
       Would make indeed some melancholy mirth;
     But this is not at present my concern,
     And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.
     With the kind view of saving an eclat,
       Both to the duchess and diplomatist,
     The Lady Adeline, as soon 's she saw
       That Juan was unlikely to resist
     (For foreigners don't know that a faux pas
       In England ranks quite on a different list
     From those of other lands unblest with juries,
     Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is);—
     The Lady Adeline resolved to take
       Such measures as she thought might best impede
     The farther progress of this sad mistake.
       She thought with some simplicity indeed;
     But innocence is bold even at the stake,
       And simple in the world, and doth not need
     Nor use those palisades by dames erected,
     Whose virtue lies in never being detected.
     It was not that she fear'd the very worst:
       His Grace was an enduring, married man,
     And was not likely all at once to burst
       Into a scene, and swell the clients' clan
     Of Doctors' Commons: but she dreaded first
       The magic of her Grace's talisman,
     And next a quarrel (as he seem'd to fret)
     With Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.
     Her Grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,
       And somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;
     One of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt
       A lover with caprices soft and dear,
     That like to make a quarrel, when they can't
       Find one, each day of the delightful year;
     Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,
     And—what is worst of all—won't let you go:
     The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,
       Or make a Werter of him in the end.
     No wonder then a purer soul should dread
       This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;
     It were much better to be wed or dead,
       Than wear a heart a woman loves to rend.
     'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,
     If that a 'bonne fortune' be really 'bonne.'
     And first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,
       Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,
     She call'd her husband now and then apart,
       And bade him counsel Juan. With a smile
     Lord Henry heard her plans of artless art
       To wean Don Juan from the siren's wile;
     And answer'd, like a statesman or a prophet,
     In such guise that she could make nothing of it.
     Firstly, he said, 'he never interfered
       In any body's business but the king's:'
     Next, that 'he never judged from what appear'd,
       Without strong reason, of those sort of things:'
     Thirdly, that 'Juan had more brain than beard,
       And was not to be held in leading strings;'
     And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,
     'That good but rarely came from good advice.'
     And, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth
       Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse
     To leave the parties to themselves, forsooth—
       At least as far as bienseance allows:
     That time would temper Juan's faults of youth;
       That young men rarely made monastic vows;
     That opposition only more attaches—
     But here a messenger brought in despatches:
     And being of the council call'd 'the Privy,'
       Lord Henry walk'd into his cabinet,
     To furnish matter for some future Livy
       To tell how he reduced the nation's debt;
     And if their full contents I do not give ye,
       It is because I do not know them yet;
     But I shall add them in a brief appendix,
     To come between mine epic and its index.
     But ere he went, he added a slight hint,
       Another gentle common-place or two,
     Such as are coin'd in conversation's mint,
       And pass, for want of better, though not new:
     Then broke his packet, to see what was in 't,
       And having casually glanced it through,
     Retired; and, as went out, calmly kiss'd her,
     Less like a young wife than an aged sister.
     He was a cold, good, honourable man,
       Proud of his birth, and proud of every thing;
     A goodly spirit for a state divan,
       A figure fit to walk before a king;
     Tall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van
       On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;
     The very model of a chamberlain—
     And such I mean to make him when I reign.
     But there was something wanting on the whole—
       I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell—
     Which pretty women—the sweet souls!—call soul.
       Certes it was not body; he was well
     Proportion'd, as a poplar or a pole,
       A handsome man, that human miracle;
     And in each circumstance of love or war
     Had still preserved his perpendicular.
     Still there was something wanting, as I 've said—
       That undefinable 'Je ne scais quoi,'
     Which, for what I know, may of yore have led
       To Homer's Iliad, since it drew to Troy
     The Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan's bed;
       Though on the whole, no doubt, the Dardan boy
     Was much inferior to King Menelaus:—
     But thus it is some women will betray us.
     There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,
       Unless like wise Tiresias we had proved
     By turns the difference of the several sexes;
       Neither can show quite how they would be loved.
     The sensual for a short time but connects us,
       The sentimental boasts to be unmoved;
     But both together form a kind of centaur,
     Upon whose back 't is better not to venture.
     A something all-sufficient for the heart
       Is that for which the sex are always seeking:
     But how to fill up that same vacant part?
       There lies the rub—and this they are but weak in.
     Frail mariners afloat without a chart,
       They run before the wind through high seas breaking;
     And when they have made the shore through every shock,
     'T is odd, or odds, it may turn out a rock.
     There is a flower call'd 'Love in Idleness,'
       For which see Shakspeare's everblooming garden;—
     I will not make his great description less,
       And beg his British godship's humble pardon,
     If in my extremity of rhyme's distress,
       I touch a single leaf where he is warden;—
     But though the flower is different, with the French
     Or Swiss Rousseau, cry 'Voila la Pervenche!'
     Eureka! I have found it! What I mean
       To say is, not that love is idleness,
     But that in love such idleness has been
       An accessory, as I have cause to guess.
     Hard labour's an indifferent go-between;
       Your men of business are not apt to express
     Much passion, since the merchant-ship, the Argo,
     Convey'd Medea as her supercargo.
     'Beatus ille procul!' from 'negotiis,'
       Saith Horace; the great little poet 's wrong;
     His other maxim, 'Noscitur a sociis,'
       Is much more to the purpose of his song;
     Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,
       Unless good company be kept too long;
     But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,
     Thrice happy they who have an occupation!
     Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,
       Eve made up millinery with fig leaves—
     The earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,
       As far as I know, that the church receives:
     And since that time it need not cost much showing,
       That many of the ills o'er which man grieves,
     And still more women, spring from not employing
     Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.
     And hence high life is oft a dreary void,
       A rack of pleasures, where we must invent
     A something wherewithal to be annoy'd.
       Bards may sing what they please about Content;
     Contented, when translated, means but cloy'd;
       And hence arise the woes of sentiment,
     Blue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances
     Reduced to practice, and perform'd like dances.
     I do declare, upon an affidavit,
       Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;
     Nor, if unto the world I ever gave it,
       Would some believe that such a tale had been:
     But such intent I never had, nor have it;
       Some truths are better kept behind a screen,
     Especially when they would look like lies;
     I therefore deal in generalities.
     'An oyster may be cross'd in love,'—and why?
       Because he mopeth idly in his shell,
     And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,
       Much as a monk may do within his cell:
     And a-propos of monks, their piety
       With sloth hath found it difficult to dwell;
     Those vegetables of the Catholic creed
     Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.
     O Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,
       Whose merit none enough can sing or say,
     Thou hast struck one immense Colossus down,
       Thou moral Washington of Africa!
     But there 's another little thing, I own,
       Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,
     And set the other halt of earth to rights;
     You have freed the blacks—now pray shut up the whites.
     Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!
       Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;
     Teach them that 'sauce for goose is sauce for gander,'
       And ask them how they like to be in thrall?
     Shut up each high heroic salamander,
       Who eats fire gratis (since the pay 's but small);
     Shut up—no, not the King, but the Pavilion,
     Or else 't will cost us all another million.
     Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;
       And you will be perhaps surprised to find
     All things pursue exactly the same route,
       As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.
     This I could prove beyond a single doubt,
       Were there a jot of sense among mankind;
     But till that point d'appui is found, alas!
     Like Archimedes, I leave earth as 't was.
     Our gentle Adeline had one defect—
       Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;
     Her conduct had been perfectly correct,
       As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.
     A wavering spirit may be easier wreck'd,
       Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;
     But when the latter works its own undoing,
     Its inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin.
     She loved her lord, or thought so; but that love
       Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,
     The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move
       Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.
     She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,
       No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:
     Their union was a model to behold,
     Serene and noble,—conjugal, but cold.
     There was no great disparity of years,
       Though much in temper; but they never clash'd:
     They moved like stars united in their spheres,
       Or like the Rhone by Leman's waters wash'd,
     Where mingled and yet separate appears
       The river from the lake, all bluely dash'd
     Through the serene and placid glassy deep,
     Which fain would lull its river-child to sleep.
     Now when she once had ta'en an interest
       In any thing, however she might flatter
     Herself that her intentions were the best,
       Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:
     Impressions were much stronger than she guess'd,
       And gather'd as they run like growing water
     Upon her mind; the more so, as her breast
     Was not at first too readily impress'd.
     But when it was, she had that lurking demon
       Of double nature, and thus doubly named—
     Firmness yclept in heroes, kings, and seamen,
       That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed
     As obstinacy, both in men and women,
       Whene'er their triumph pales, or star is tamed:—
     And 't will perplex the casuist in morality
     To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.
     Had Buonaparte won at Waterloo,
       It had been firmness; now 't is pertinacity:
     Must the event decide between the two?
       I leave it to your people of sagacity
     To draw the line between the false and true,
       If such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:
     My business is with Lady Adeline,
     Who in her way too was a heroine.
     She knew not her own heart; then how should I?
       I think not she was then in love with Juan:
     If so, she would have had the strength to fly
       The wild sensation, unto her a new one:
     She merely felt a common sympathy
       (I will not say it was a false or true one)
     In him, because she thought he was in danger,—
     Her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,
     She was, or thought she was, his friend—and this
       Without the farce of friendship, or romance
     Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss
       Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,
     Or Germany, where people purely kiss.
       To thus much Adeline would not advance;
     But of such friendship as man's may to man be
     She was as capable as woman can be.
     No doubt the secret influence of the sex
       Will there, as also in the ties of blood,
     An innocent predominance annex,
       And tune the concord to a finer mood.
     If free from passion, which all friendship checks,
       And your true feelings fully understood,
     No friend like to a woman earth discovers,
     So that you have not been nor will be lovers.
     Love bears within its breast the very germ
       Of change; and how should this be otherwise?
     That violent things more quickly find a term
       Is shown through nature's whole analogies;
     And how should the most fierce of all be firm?
       Would you have endless lightning in the skies?
     Methinks Love's very title says enough:
     How should 'the tender passion' e'er be tough?
     Alas! by all experience, seldom yet
       (I merely quote what I have heard from many)
     Had lovers not some reason to regret
       The passion which made Solomon a zany.
     I 've also seen some wives (not to forget
       The marriage state, the best or worst of any)
     Who were the very paragons of wives,
     Yet made the misery of at least two lives.
     I 've also seen some female friends ( 't is odd,
       But true—as, if expedient, I could prove)
     That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,
       At home, far more than ever yet was Love—
     Who did not quit me when Oppression trod
       Upon me; whom no scandal could remove;
     Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,
     Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.
     Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline
       Grew friends in this or any other sense,
     Will be discuss'd hereafter, I opine:
       At present I am glad of a pretence
     To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,
       And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;
     The surest way for ladies and for books
     To bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks.
     Whether they rode, or walk'd, or studied Spanish
       To read Don Quixote in the original,
     A pleasure before which all others vanish;
       Whether their talk was of the kind call'd 'small,'
     Or serious, are the topics I must banish
       To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall
     Say something to the purpose, and display
     Considerable talent in my way.
     Above all, I beg all men to forbear
       Anticipating aught about the matter:
     They 'll only make mistakes about the fair,
       And Juan too, especially the latter.
     And I shall take a much more serious air
       Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.
     It is not clear that Adeline and Juan
     Will fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.
     But great things spring from little:—Would you think,
       That in our youth, as dangerous a passion
     As e'er brought man and woman to the brink
       Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,
     As few would ever dream could form the link
       Of such a sentimental situation?
     You 'll never guess, I 'll bet you millions, milliards—
     It all sprung from a harmless game at billiards.
     'T is strange,—but true; for truth is always strange;
       Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,
     How much would novels gain by the exchange!
       How differently the world would men behold!
     How oft would vice and virtue places change!
       The new world would be nothing to the old,
     If some Columbus of the moral seas
     Would show mankind their souls' antipodes.
     What 'antres vast and deserts idle' then
       Would be discover'd in the human soul!
     What icebergs in the hearts of mighty men,
       With self-love in the centre as their pole!
     What Anthropophagi are nine of ten
       Of those who hold the kingdoms in control
     Were things but only call'd by their right name,
     Caesar himself would be ashamed of fame.
CANTO THE FIFTEENTH.
     Ah!—What should follow slips from my reflection;
       Whatever follows ne'ertheless may be
     As à propos of hope or retrospection,
       As though the lurking thought had follow'd free.
     All present life is but an interjection,
       An 'Oh!' or 'Ah!' of joy or misery,
     Or a 'Ha! ha!' or 'Bah!'—a yawn, or 'Pooh!'
     Of which perhaps the latter is most true.
     But, more or less, the whole 's a syncope
       Or a singultus—emblems of emotion,
     The grand antithesis to great ennui,
       Wherewith we break our bubbles on the ocean,—
     That watery outline of eternity,
       Or miniature at least, as is my notion,
     Which ministers unto the soul's delight,
     In seeing matters which are out of sight.
     But all are better than the sigh supprest,
       Corroding in the cavern of the heart,
     Making the countenance a masque of rest,
       And turning human nature to an art.
     Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;
       Dissimulation always sets apart
     A corner for herself; and therefore fiction
     Is that which passes with least contradiction.
     Ah! who can tell? Or rather, who can not
       Remember, without telling, passion's errors?
     The drainer of oblivion, even the sot,
       Hath got blue devils for his morning mirrors:
     What though on Lethe's stream he seem to float,
       He cannot sink his tremors or his terrors;
     The ruby glass that shakes within his hand
     Leaves a sad sediment of Time's worst sand.
     And as for love—O love!—We will proceed.
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville,
     A pretty name as one would wish to read,
       Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.
     There 's music in the sighing of a reed;
       There 's music in the gushing of a rill;
     There 's music in all things, if men had ears:
     Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.
     The Lady Adeline, right honourable;
       And honour'd, ran a risk of growing less so;
     For few of the soft sex are very stable
       In their resolves—alas! that I should say so!
     They differ as wine differs from its label,
       When once decanted;—I presume to guess so,
     But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,
     Till old, may undergo adulteration.
     But Adeline was of the purest vintage,
       The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet
     Bright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,
       Or glorious as a diamond richly set;
     A page where Time should hesitate to print age,
       And for which Nature might forego her debt—
     Sole creditor whose process doth involve in 't
     The luck of finding every body solvent.
     O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily
       Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,
     Like a meek tradesman when, approaching palely,
       Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:
     But oft denied, as patience 'gins to fail, he
       Advances with exasperated rap,
     And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,
     On ready money, or 'a draft on Ransom.'
     Whate'er thou takest, spare a while poor Beauty!
       She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.
     What though she now and then may slip from duty,
       The more 's the reason why you ought to stay.
     Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,
       You should be civil in a modest way:
     Suppress, then, some slight feminine diseases,
     And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.
     Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous
       Where she was interested (as was said),
     Because she was not apt, like some of us,
       To like too readily, or too high bred
     To show it (points we need not now discuss)—
       Would give up artlessly both heart and head
     Unto such feelings as seem'd innocent,
     For objects worthy of the sentiment.
     Some parts of Juan's history, which Rumour,
       That live gazette, had scatter'd to disfigure,
     She had heard; but women hear with more good humour
       Such aberrations than we men of rigour:
     Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more
       Strict, and his mind assumed a manlier vigour;
     Because he had, like Alcibiades,
     The art of living in all climes with ease.
     His manner was perhaps the more seductive,
       Because he ne'er seem'd anxious to seduce;
     Nothing affected, studied, or constructive
       Of coxcombry or conquest: no abuse
     Of his attractions marr'd the fair perspective,
       To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,
     And seem to say, 'Resist us if you can'-
     Which makes a dandy while it spoils a man.
     They are wrong—that 's not the way to set about it;
       As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.
     But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;
       In fact, his manner was his own alone;
     Sincere he was—at least you could not doubt it,
       In listening merely to his voice's tone.
     The devil hath not in all his quiver's choice
     An arrow for the heart like a sweet voice.
     By nature soft, his whole address held off
       Suspicion: though not timid, his regard
     Was such as rather seem'd to keep aloof,
       To shield himself than put you on your guard:
     Perhaps 't was hardly quite assured enough,
       But modesty 's at times its own reward,
     Like virtue; and the absence of pretension
     Will go much farther than there 's need to mention.
     Serene, accomplish'd, cheerful but not loud;
       Insinuating without insinuation;
     Observant of the foibles of the crowd,
       Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;
     Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,
       So as to make them feel he knew his station
     And theirs:—without a struggle for priority,
     He neither brook'd nor claim'd superiority.
     That is, with men: with women he was what
       They pleased to make or take him for; and their
     Imagination 's quite enough for that:
       So that the outline 's tolerably fair,
     They fill the canvas up—and 'verbum sat.'
       If once their phantasies be brought to bear
     Upon an object, whether sad or playful,
     They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.
     Adeline, no deep judge of character,
       Was apt to add a colouring from her own:
     'T is thus the good will amiably err,
       And eke the wise, as has been often shown.
     Experience is the chief philosopher,
       But saddest when his science is well known:
     And persecuted sages teach the schools
     Their folly in forgetting there are fools.
     Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?
       Great Socrates? And thou, Diviner still,
     Whose lot it is by man to be mistaken,
       And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?
     Redeeming worlds to be by bigots shaken,
       How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill
     Volumes with similar sad illustrations,
     But leave them to the conscience of the nations.
     I perch upon an humbler promontory,
       Amidst life's infinite variety:
     With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,
       But speculating as I cast mine eye
     On what may suit or may not suit my story,
       And never straining hard to versify,
     I rattle on exactly as I 'd talk
     With any body in a ride or walk.
     I don't know that there may be much ability
       Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;
     But there 's a conversational facility,
       Which may round off an hour upon a time.
     Of this I 'm sure at least, there 's no servility
       In mine irregularity of chime,
     Which rings what 's uppermost of new or hoary,
     Just as I feel the 'Improvvisatore.'
     'Omnia vult belle Matho dicere—dic aliquando
       Et bene, dic neutrum, dic aliquando male.'
     The first is rather more than mortal can do;
       The second may be sadly done or gaily;
     The third is still more difficult to stand to;
       The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily.
     The whole together is what I could wish
     To serve in this conundrum of a dish.
     A modest hope—but modesty 's my forte,
       And pride my feeble:—let us ramble on.
     I meant to make this poem very short,
       But now I can't tell where it may not run.
     No doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court
       To critics, or to hail the setting sun
     Of tyranny of all kinds, my concision
     Were more;—but I was born for opposition.
     But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;
       So that I verily believe if they
     Who now are basking in their full-blown pride
       Were shaken down, and 'dogs had had their day,'
     Though at the first I might perchance deride
       Their tumble, I should turn the other way,
     And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,
     Because I hate even democratic royalty.
     I think I should have made a decent spouse,
       If I had never proved the soft condition;
     I think I should have made monastic vows,
       But for my own peculiar superstition:
     'Gainst rhyme I never should have knock'd my brows,
       Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,
     Nor worn the motley mantle of a poet,
     If some one had not told me to forego it.
     But 'laissez aller'—knights and dames I sing,
       Such as the times may furnish. 'T is a flight
     Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,
       Plumed by Longinus or the Stagyrite:
     The difficultly lies in colouring
       (Keeping the due proportions still in sight)
     With nature manners which are artificial,
     And rend'ring general that which is especial.
     The difference is, that in the days of old
       Men made the manners; manners now make men—
     Pinn'd like a flock, and fleeced too in their fold,
       At least nine, and a ninth beside of ten.
     Now this at all events must render cold
       Your writers, who must either draw again
     Days better drawn before, or else assume
     The present, with their common-place costume.
     We 'll do our best to make the best on 't:—March!
       March, my Muse! If you cannot fly, yet flutter;
     And when you may not be sublime, be arch,
       Or starch, as are the edicts statesmen utter.
     We surely may find something worth research:
       Columbus found a new world in a cutter,
     Or brigantine, or pink, of no great tonnage,
     While yet America was in her non-age.
     When Adeline, in all her growing sense
       Of Juan's merits and his situation,
     Felt on the whole an interest intense,—
       Partly perhaps because a fresh sensation,
     Or that he had an air of innocence,
       Which is for innocence a sad temptation,—
     As women hate half measures, on the whole,
     She 'gan to ponder how to save his soul.
     She had a good opinion of advice,
       Like all who give and eke receive it gratis,
     For which small thanks are still the market price,
       Even where the article at highest rate is:
     She thought upon the subject twice or thrice,
       And morally decided, the best state is
     For morals, marriage; and this question carried,
     She seriously advised him to get married.
     Juan replied, with all becoming deference,
       He had a predilection for that tie;
     But that, at present, with immediate reference
       To his own circumstances, there might lie
     Some difficulties, as in his own preference,
       Or that of her to whom he might apply:
     That still he 'd wed with such or such a lady,
     If that they were not married all already.
     Next to the making matches for herself,
       And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,
     Arranging them like books on the same shelf,
       There 's nothing women love to dabble in
     More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)
       Than match-making in general: 't is no sin
     Certes, but a preventative, and therefore
     That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.
     But never yet (except of course a miss
       Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,
     Or wed already, who object to this)
       Was there chaste dame who had not in her head
     Some drama of the marriage unities,
       Observed as strictly both at board and bed
     As those of Aristotle, though sometimes
     They turn out melodrames or pantomimes.
     They generally have some only son,
       Some heir to a large property, some friend
     Of an old family, some gay Sir john,
       Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end
     A line, and leave posterity undone,
       Unless a marriage was applied to mend
     The prospect and their morals: and besides,
     They have at hand a blooming glut of brides.
     From these they will be careful to select,
       For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;
     For one a songstress who hath no defect,
       For t' other one who promises much duty;
     For this a lady no one can reject,
       Whose sole accomplishments were quite a booty;
     A second for her excellent connections;
     A third, because there can be no objections.
     When Rapp the Harmonist embargo'd marriage
       In his harmonious settlement (which flourishes
     Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,
       Because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes,
     Without those sad expenses which disparage
       What Nature naturally most encourages)—
     Why call'd he 'Harmony' a state sans wedlock?
     Now here I 've got the preacher at a dead lock.
     Because he either meant to sneer at harmony
       Or marriage, by divorcing them thus oddly.
     But whether reverend Rapp learn'd this in Germany
       Or no, 't is said his sect is rich and godly,
     Pious and pure, beyond what I can term any
       Of ours, although they propagate more broadly.
     My objection 's to his title, not his ritual,
     Although I wonder how it grew habitual.
     But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,
       Who favour, malgre Malthus, generation—
     Professors of that genial art, and patrons
       Of all the modest part of propagation;
     Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,
       That half its produce tends to emigration,
     That sad result of passions and potatoes—
     Two weeds which pose our economic Catos.
     Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;
       I wish she had: his book 's the eleventh commandment,
     Which says, 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well:
       This he (as far as I can understand) meant.
     'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell
       Nor canvass what so 'eminent a hand' meant;
     But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,
     Or turning marriage into arithmetic.
     But Adeline, who probably presumed
       That Juan had enough of maintenance,
     Or separate maintenance, in case 't was doom'd—
       As on the whole it is an even chance
     That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,
       May retrograde a little in the dance
     Of marriage (which might form a painter's fame,
     Like Holbein's 'Dance of Death'—but 't is the same);—
     But Adeline determined Juan's wedding
       In her own mind, and that 's enough for woman:
     But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,
       Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman.
     And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.
       She deem'd his merits something more than common:
     All these were unobjectionable matches,
     And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.
     There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,
       That usual paragon, an only daughter,
     Who seem'd the cream of equanimity
       Till skimm'd—and then there was some milk and water,
     With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,
       Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?
     Love 's riotous, but marriage should have quiet,
     And being consumptive, live on a milk diet.
     And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,
       A dashing demoiselle of good estate,
     Whose heart was fix'd upon a star or blue string;
       But whether English dukes grew rare of late,
     Or that she had not harp'd upon the true string,
       By which such sirens can attract our great,
     She took up with some foreign younger brother,
     A Russ or Turk—the one 's as good as t' other.
     And then there was—but why should I go on,
       Unless the ladies should go off?—there was
     Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,
       Of the best class, and better than her class,—
     Aurora Raby, a young star who shone
       O'er life, too sweet an image for such glass,
     A lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,
     A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;
     Rich, noble, but an orphan; left an only
       Child to the care of guardians good and kind;
     But still her aspect had an air so lonely!
       Blood is not water; and where shall we find
     Feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie
       By death, when we are left, alas! behind,
     To feel, in friendless palaces, a home
     Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?
     Early in years, and yet more infantine
       In figure, she had something of sublime
     In eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine.
       All youth—but with an aspect beyond time;
     Radiant and grave—as pitying man's decline;
       Mournful—but mournful of another's crime,
     She look'd as if she sat by Eden's door.
     And grieved for those who could return no more.
     She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,
       As far as her own gentle heart allow'd,
     And deem'd that fallen worship far more dear
       Perhaps because 't was fallen: her sires were proud
     Of deeds and days when they had fill'd the ear
       Of nations, and had never bent or bow'd
     To novel power; and as she was the last,
     She held their old faith and old feelings fast.
     She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,
       As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,
     As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,
       And kept her heart serene within its zone.
     There was awe in the homage which she drew;
       Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne
     Apart from the surrounding world, and strong
     In its own strength—most strange in one so young!
     Now it so happen'd, in the catalogue
       Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,
     Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue
       Beyond the charmers we have already cited;
     Her beauty also seem'd to form no clog
       Against her being mention'd as well fitted,
     By many virtues, to be worth the trouble
     Of single gentlemen who would be double.
     And this omission, like that of the bust
       Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,
     Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.
       This he express'd half smiling and half serious;
     When Adeline replied with some disgust,
       And with an air, to say the least, imperious,
     She marvell'd 'what he saw in such a baby
     As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?'
     Juan rejoin'd—'She was a Catholic,
       And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;
     Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,
       And the Pope thunder excommunication,
     If-' But here Adeline, who seem'd to pique
       Herself extremely on the inoculation
     Of others with her own opinions, stated—
     As usual—the same reason which she late did.
     And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,
       If good, is none the worse for repetition;
     If bad, the best way 's certainly to tease on,
       And amplify: you lose much by concision,
     Whereas insisting in or out of season
       Convinces all men, even a politician;
     Or—what is just the same—it wearies out.
     So the end 's gain'd, what signifies the route?
     Why Adeline had this slight prejudice—
       For prejudice it was—against a creature
     As pure as sanctity itself from vice,
       With all the added charm of form and feature,
     For me appears a question far too nice,
       Since Adeline was liberal by nature;
     But nature 's nature, and has more caprices
     Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.
     Perhaps she did not like the quiet way
       With which Aurora on those baubles look'd,
     Which charm most people in their earlier day:
       For there are few things by mankind less brook'd,
     And womankind too, if we so may say,
       Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,
     Like 'Anthony's by Caesar,' by the few
     Who look upon them as they ought to do.
     It was not envy—Adeline had none;
       Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.
     It was not scorn—which could not light on one
       Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find.
     It was not jealousy, I think: but shun
       Following the 'ignes fatui' of mankind.
     It was not—but 't is easier far, alas!
     To say what it was not than what it was.
     Little Aurora deem'd she was the theme
       Of such discussion. She was there a guest;
     A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream
       Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,
     Which flow'd on for a moment in the beam
       Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.
     Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled—
     She had so much, or little, of the child.
     The dashing and proud air of Adeline
       Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze
     Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,
       Then turn'd unto the stars for loftier rays.
     Juan was something she could not divine,
       Being no sibyl in the new world's ways;
     Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,
     Because she did not pin her faith on feature.
     His fame too,—for he had that kind of fame
       Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,
     A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,
       Half virtues and whole vices being combined;
     Faults which attract because they are not tame;
       Follies trick'd out so brightly that they blind:—
     These seals upon her wax made no impression,
     Such was her coldness or her self-possession.
     Juan knew nought of such a character—
       High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;
     Yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:
       The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,
     More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,
       Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,
     Nor would be thus:—the difference in them
     Was such as lies between a flower and gem.
     Having wound up with this sublime comparison,
       Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,
     And, as my friend Scott says, 'I sound my warison;'
       Scott, the superlative of my comparative—
     Scott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,
       Serf, lord, man, with such skill as none would share it, if
     There had not been one Shakspeare and Voltaire,
     Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.
     I say, in my slight way I may proceed
       To play upon the surface of humanity.
     I write the world, nor care if the world read,
       At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.
     My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed
       More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I
     Thought that it might turn out so—now I know it,
     But still I am, or was, a pretty poet.
     The conference or congress (for it ended
       As congresses of late do) of the Lady
     Adeline and Don Juan rather blended
       Some acids with the sweets—for she was heady;
     But, ere the matter could be marr'd or mended,
       The silvery bell rang, not for 'dinner ready,
     But for that hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,
     Though ladies' robes seem scant enough for less.
     Great things were now to be achieved at table,
       With massy plate for armour, knives and forks
     For weapons; but what Muse since Homer 's able
       (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)
     To draw up in array a single day-bill
       Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,
     In soups or sauces, or a sole ragout,
       Than witches, b—ches, or physicians, brew.
     There was a goodly 'soupe a la bonne femme,'
       Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,
     A turbot for relief of those who cram,
       Relieved with 'dindon a la Parigeux;'
     There also was——the sinner that I am!
       How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?-
     'Soupe a la Beauveau,' whose relief was dory,
     Relieved itself by pork, for greater glory.
     But I must crowd all into one grand mess
       Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,
     My Muse would run much more into excess,
       Than when some squeamish people deem her frail.
     But though a 'bonne vivante,' I must confess
       Her stomach 's not her peccant part; this tale
     However doth require some slight refection,
     Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.
     Fowls 'a la Conde,' slices eke of salmon,
       With 'sauces Genevoises,' and haunch of venison;
     Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon—
       A man like whom I hope we shan't see many soon;
     They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,
       Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;
     And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,
     As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.
     Then there was God knows what 'a l'Allemande,'
       'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'-
     With things I can't withstand or understand,
       Though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;
     And 'entremets' to piddle with at hand,
       Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;
     While great Lucullus' Robe triumphal muffles
     (There 's fame) young partridge fillets, deck'd with truffles.
     What are the fillets on the victor's brow
       To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch
     Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?
       Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?
     Gone to where victories must like dinners go.
       Farther I shall not follow the research:
     But oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,
     When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?
     Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,
       Follow'd by 'petits puits d'amour'—a dish
     Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,
       So every one may dress it to his wish,
     According to the best of dictionaries,
       Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;
     But even sans 'confitures,' it no less true is,
     There 's pretty picking in those 'petits puits.'
     The mind is lost in mighty contemplation
       Of intellect expanded on two courses;
     And indigestion's grand multiplication
       Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.
     Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,
       That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,
     As form a science and a nomenclature
     From out the commonest demands of nature?
     The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;
       The diners of celebrity dined well;
     The ladies with more moderation mingled
       In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;
     Also the younger men too: for a springald
       Can't, like ripe age, in gormandize excel,
     But thinks less of good eating than the whisper
     (When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.
     Alas! I must leave undescribed the gibier,
       The salmi, the consomme, the puree,
     All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber
       Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:
     I must not introduce even a spare rib here,
       'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:
     But I have dined, and must forego, Alas!
     The chaste description even of a 'becasse;'
     And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines
       From nature for the service of the gout—
     Taste or the gout,—pronounce it as inclines
       Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;
     But after, there are sometimes certain signs
       Which prove plain English truer of the two.
     Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it—
     But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.
     The simple olives, best allies of wine,
       Must I pass over in my bill of fare?
     I must, although a favourite 'plat' of mine
       In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, every where:
     On them and bread 't was oft my luck to dine,
       The grass my table-cloth, in open-air,
     On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,
     Of whom half my philosophy the progeny is.
     Amidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and 'fowl,
       And vegetables, all in masquerade,
     The guests were placed according to their roll,
       But various as the various meats display'd:
     Don Juan sat next 'an l'Espagnole'-
       No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;
     But so far like a lady, that 't was drest
     Superbly, and contain'd a world of zest.
     By some odd chance too, he was placed between
       Aurora and the Lady Adeline—
     A situation difficult, I ween,
       For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.
     Also the conference which we have seen
       Was not such as to encourage him to shine;
     For Adeline, addressing few words to him,
     With two transcendent eyes seem'd to look through him.
     I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:
       This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things
     Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,
       Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.
     Like that same mystic music of the spheres,
       Which no one bears, so loudly though it rings,
     'T is wonderful how oft the sex have heard
     Long dialogues—which pass'd without a word!
     Aurora sat with that indifference
       Which piques a preux chevalier—as it ought:
     Of all offences that 's the worst offence,
       Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.
     Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,
       Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;
     Like a good ship entangled among ice,
     And after so much excellent advice.
     To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,
       Or something which was nothing, as urbanity
     Required. Aurora scarcely look'd aside,
       Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.
     The devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?
       Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?
     Heaven knows? But Adeline's malicious eyes
     Sparkled with her successful prophecies,
     And look'd as much as if to say, 'I said it;'
       A kind of triumph I 'll not recommend,
     Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,
       Both in the case of lover and of friend,
     Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,
       To bring what was a jest to a serious end:
     For all men prophesy what is or was,
     And hate those who won't let them come to pass.
     Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,
       Slight but select, and just enough to express,
     To females of perspicuous comprehensions,
       That he would rather make them more than less.
     Aurora at the last (so history mentions,
       Though probably much less a fact than guess)
     So far relax'd her thoughts from their sweet prison,
     As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.
     From answering she began to question; this
       With her was rare: and Adeline, who as yet
     Thought her predictions went not much amiss,
       Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette—
     So very difficult, they say, it is
       To keep extremes from meeting, when once set
     In motion; but she here too much refined—
     Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.
     But Juan had a sort of winning way,
       A proud humility, if such there be,
     Which show'd such deference to what females say,
       As if each charming word were a decree.
     His tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,
       And taught him when to be reserved or free:
     He had the art of drawing people out,
     Without their seeing what he was about.
     Aurora, who in her indifference
       Confounded him in common with the crowd
     Of flatterers, though she deem'd he had more sense
       Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud—
     Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)
       To feel that flattery which attracts the proud
     Rather by deference than compliment,
     And wins even by a delicate dissent.
     And then he had good looks;—that point was carried
       Nem. con. amongst the women, which I grieve
     To say leads oft to crim. con. with the married—
       A case which to the juries we may leave,
     Since with digressions we too long have tarried.
       Now though we know of old that looks deceive,
     And always have done, somehow these good looks
     Make more impression than the best of books.
     Aurora, who look'd more on books than faces,
       Was very young, although so very sage,
     Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,
       Especially upon a printed page.
     But Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,
       Has not the natural stays of strict old age;
     And Socrates, that model of all duty,
     Own'd to a penchant, though discreet, for beauty.
     And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,
       But innocently so, as Socrates;
     And really, if the sage sublime and Attic
       At seventy years had phantasies like these,
     Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic
       Has shown, I know not why they should displease
     In virgins—always in a modest way,
     Observe; for that with me 's a 'sine qua.'
     Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke
       (See Littleton), whene'er I have express'd
     Opinions two, which at first sight may look
       Twin opposites, the second is the best.
     Perhaps I have a third, too, in a nook,
       Or none at all—which seems a sorry jest:
     But if a writer should be quite consistent,
     How could he possibly show things existent?
     If people contradict themselves, can I
       Help contradicting them, and every body,
     Even my veracious self?—But that 's a lie:
       I never did so, never will—how should I?
     He who doubts all things nothing can deny:
       Truth's fountains may be clear—her streams are muddy,
     And cut through such canals of contradiction,
     That she must often navigate o'er fiction.
     Apologue, fable, poesy, and parable,
       Are false, but may he render'd also true,
     By those who sow them in a land that 's arable.
       'T is wonderful what fable will not do!
     'T is said it makes reality more bearable:
       But what 's reality? Who has its clue?
     Philosophy? No: she too much rejects.
     Religion? Yes; but which of all her sects?
     Some millions must be wrong, that 's pretty dear;
       Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.
     God help us! Since we have need on our career
       To keep our holy beacons always bright,
     'T is time that some new prophet should appear,
       Or old indulge man with a second sight.
     Opinions wear out in some thousand years,
     Without a small refreshment from the spheres.
     But here again, why will I thus entangle
       Myself with metaphysics? None can hate
     So much as I do any kind of wrangle;
       And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,
     I always knock my head against some angle
       About the present, past, or future state.
     Yet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,
     For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.
     But though I am a temperate theologian,
       And also meek as a metaphysician,
     Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,
       As Eldon on a lunatic commission—
     In politics my duty is to show John
       Bull something of the lower world's condition.
     It makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,
     To see men let these scoundrel sovereigns break law.
     But politics, and policy, and piety,
       Are topics which I sometimes introduce,
     Not only for the sake of their variety,
       But as subservient to a moral use;
     Because my business is to dress society,
       And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.
     And now, that we may furnish with some matter all
     Tastes, we are going to try the supernatural.
     And now I will give up all argument;
       And positively henceforth no temptation
     Shall 'fool me to the top up of my bent:'-
       Yes, I' ll begin a thorough reformation.
     Indeed, I never knew what people meant
       By deeming that my Muse's conversation
     Was dangerous;—I think she is as harmless
     As some who labour more and yet may charm less.
     Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?
       No; but you have heard—I understand—be dumb!
     And don't regret the time you may have lost,
       For you have got that pleasure still to come:
     And do not think I mean to sneer at most
       Of these things, or by ridicule benumb
     That source of the sublime and the mysterious:—
     For certain reasons my belief is serious.
     Serious? You laugh;—you may: that will I not;
       My smiles must be sincere or not at all.
     I say I do believe a haunted spot
       Exists—and where? That shall I not recall,
     Because I 'd rather it should be forgot,
       'Shadows the soul of Richard' may appal.
     In short, upon that subject I 've some qualms very
     Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.
     The night (I sing by night—sometimes an owl,
       And now and then a nightingale) is dim,
     And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl
       Rattles around me her discordant hymn:
     Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl—
       I wish to heaven they would not look so grim;
     The dying embers dwindle in the grate—
     I think too that I have sate up too late:
     And therefore, though 't is by no means my way
       To rhyme at noon—when I have other things
     To think of, if I ever think—I say
       I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,
     And prudently postpone, until mid-day,
       Treating a topic which, alas! but brings
     Shadows;—but you must be in my condition
     Before you learn to call this superstition.
CANTO THE SIXTEENTH.
     The antique Persians taught three useful things,
       To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth.
     This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings—
       A mode adopted since by modern youth.
     Bows have they, generally with two strings;
       Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;
     At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,
     But draw the long bow better now than ever.
     The cause of this effect, or this defect,—
       'For this effect defective comes by cause,'-
     Is what I have not leisure to inspect;
       But this I must say in my own applause,
     Of all the Muses that I recollect,
       Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws
     In some things, mine 's beyond all contradiction
     The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.
     And as she treats all things, and ne'er retreats
       From any thing, this epic will contain
     A wilderness of the most rare conceits,
       Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.
     'T is true there be some bitters with the sweets,
       Yet mix'd so slightly, that you can't complain,
     But wonder they so few are, since my tale is
     'De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis.'
     But of all truths which she has told, the most
       True is that which she is about to tell.
     I said it was a story of a ghost—
       What then? I only know it so befell.
     Have you explored the limits of the coast,
       Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?
     'T is time to strike such puny doubters dumb as
     The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.
     Some people would impose now with authority,
       Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;
     Men whose historical superiority
       Is always greatest at a miracle.
     But Saint Augustine has the great priority,
       Who bids all men believe the impossible,
     Because 't is so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he
     Quiets at once with 'quia impossibile.'
     And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;
       Believe:—if 't is improbable you must,
     And if it is impossible, you shall:
       'T is always best to take things upon trust.
     I do not speak profanely, to recall
       Those holier mysteries which the wise and just
     Receive as gospel, and which grow more rooted,
     As all truths must, the more they are disputed:
     I merely mean to say what Johnson said,
       That in the course of some six thousand years,
     All nations have believed that from the dead
       A visitant at intervals appears;
     And what is strangest upon this strange head,
       Is, that whatever bar the reason rears
     'Gainst such belief, there 's something stronger still
     In its behalf, let those deny who will.
     The dinner and the soiree too were done,
       The supper too discuss'd, the dames admired,
     The banqueteers had dropp'd off one by one—
       The song was silent, and the dance expired:
     The last thin petticoats were vanish'd, gone
       Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,
     And nothing brighter gleam'd through the saloon
     Than dying tapers—and the peeping moon.
     The evaporation of a joyous day
       Is like the last glass of champagne, without
     The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;
       Or like a system coupled with a doubt;
     Or like a soda bottle when its spray
       Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;
     Or like a billow left by storms behind,
     Without the animation of the wind;
     Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,
       Or none; or like—like nothing that I know
     Except itself;—such is the human breast;
       A thing, of which similitudes can show
     No real likeness,—like the old Tyrian vest
       Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,
     If from a shell-fish or from cochineal.
     So perish every tyrant's robe piece-meal!
     But next to dressing for a rout or ball,
       Undressing is a woe; our robe de chambre
     May sit like that of Nessus, and recall
       Thoughts quite as yellow, but less clear than amber.
     Titus exclaim'd, 'I 've lost a day!' Of all
       The nights and days most people can remember
     (I have had of both, some not to be disdain'd),
     I wish they 'd state how many they have gain'd.
     And Juan, on retiring for the night,
       Felt restless, and perplex'd, and compromised:
     He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright
       Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;
     If he had known exactly his own plight,
       He probably would have philosophised:
     A great resource to all, and ne'er denied
     Till wanted; therefore Juan only sigh'd.
     He sigh'd;—the next resource is the full moon,
       Where all sighs are deposited; and now
     It happen'd luckily, the chaste orb shone
       As clear as such a climate will allow;
     And Juan's mind was in the proper tone
       To hail her with the apostrophe—'O thou!'
     Of amatory egotism the Tuism,
     Which further to explain would be a truism.
     But lover, poet, or astronomer,
       Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,
     Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:
       Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold
     Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);
       Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;
     The ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,
     And also hearts, if there be truth in lays.
     Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed
       For contemplation rather than his pillow:
     The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,
       Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,
     With all the mystery by midnight caused;
       Below his window waved (of course) a willow;
     And he stood gazing out on the cascade
     That flash'd and after darken'd in the shade.
     Upon his table or his toilet,—which
       Of these is not exactly ascertain'd
     (I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch
       Of nicety, where a fact is to be gain'd),—
     A lamp burn'd high, while he leant from a niche,
       Where many a Gothic ornament remain'd,
     In chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all
     That time has left our fathers of their hall.
     Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw
       His chamber door wide open—and went forth
     Into a gallery, of a sombre hue,
       Long, furnish'd with old pictures of great worth,
     Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,
       As doubtless should be people of high birth.
     But by dim lights the portraits of the dead
     Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.
     The forms of the grim knight and pictured saint
       Look living in the moon; and as you turn
     Backward and forward to the echoes faint
       Of your own footsteps—voices from the urn
     Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint
       Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,
     As if to ask how you can dare to keep
     A vigil there, where all but death should sleep.
     And the pale smile of beauties in the grave,
       The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,
     Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave
       Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams
     On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,
       But death is imaged in their shadowy beams.
     A picture is the past; even ere its frame
     Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.
     As Juan mused on mutability,
       Or on his mistress—terms synonymous—
     No sound except the echo of his sigh
       Or step ran sadly through that antique house;
     When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,
       A supernatural agent—or a mouse,
     Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass
     Most people as it plays along the arras.
     It was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd
       In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,
     Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,
       With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;
     His garments only a slight murmur made;
       He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,
     But slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,
     Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.
     Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint
       Of such a spirit in these halls of old,
     But thought, like most men, there was nothing in 't
       Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,
     Coin'd from surviving superstition's mint,
       Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,
     But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.
     And did he see this? or was it a vapour?
     Once, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd—the thing of air,
       Or earth beneath, or heaven, or t' other place;
     And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,
       Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base
     As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair
       Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;
     He tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,
     To ask the reverend person what he wanted.
     The third time, after a still longer pause,
       The shadow pass'd away—but where? the hall
     Was long, and thus far there was no great cause
       To think his vanishing unnatural:
     Doors there were many, through which, by the laws
       Of physics, bodies whether short or tall
     Might come or go; but Juan could not state
     Through which the spectre seem'd to evaporate.
     He stood—how long he knew not, but it seem'd
       An age—expectant, powerless, with his eyes
     Strain'd on the spot where first the figure gleam'd;
       Then by degrees recall'd his energies,
     And would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,
       But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,
     Waking already, and return'd at length
     Back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.
     All there was as he left it: still his taper
       Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,
     Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;
       He rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse
     Their office; he took up an old newspaper;
       The paper was right easy to peruse;
     He read an article the king attacking,
     And a long eulogy of 'patent blacking.'
     This savour'd of this world; but his hand shook—
       He shut his door, and after having read
     A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,
       Undrest, and rather slowly went to bed.
     There, couch'd all snugly on his pillow's nook,
       With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;
     And though it was no opiate, slumber crept
     Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.
     He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,
       Ponder'd upon his visitant or vision,
     And whether it ought not to be disclosed,
       At risk of being quizz'd for superstition.
     The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:
       In the mean time, his valet, whose precision
     Was great, because his master brook'd no less,
     Knock'd to inform him it was time to dress.
     He dress'd; and like young people he was wont
       To take some trouble with his toilet, but
     This morning rather spent less time upon 't;
       Aside his very mirror soon was put;
     His curls fell negligently o'er his front,
       His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,
     His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied
     Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.
     And when he walk'd down into the saloon,
       He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,
     Which he perhaps had not discover'd soon,
       Had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,
     Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;
       So much distrait he was, that all could see
     That something was the matter—Adeline
     The first—but what she could not well divine.
     She look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale
       Herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd
     Something, but what 's not stated in my tale.
       Lord Henry said his muffin was ill butter'd;
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke play'd with her veil,
       And look'd at Juan hard, but nothing utter'd.
     Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes
     Survey'd him with a kind of calm surprise.
     But seeing him all cold and silent still,
       And everybody wondering more or less,
     Fair Adeline enquired, 'If he were ill?'
       He started, and said, 'Yes—no—rather—yes.'
     The family physician had great skill,
       And being present, now began to express
     His readiness to feel his pulse and tell
     The cause, but Juan said, 'He was quite well.'
     'Quite well; yes,—no.'—These answers were mysterious,
       And yet his looks appear'd to sanction both,
     However they might savour of delirious;
       Something like illness of a sudden growth
     Weigh'd on his spirit, though by no means serious:
       But for the rest, as he himself seem'd loth
     To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted
     It was not the physician that he wanted.
     Lord Henry, who had now discuss'd his chocolate,
       Also the muffin whereof he complain'd,
     Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,
       At which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;
     Then ask'd her Grace what news were of the duke of late?
       Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain'd
     With some slight, light, hereditary twinges
     Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.
     Then Henry turn'd to Juan, and address'd
       A few words of condolence on his state:
     'You look,' quoth he, 'as if you had had your rest
       Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.'
     'What friar?' said Juan; and he did his best
       To put the question with an air sedate,
     Or careless; but the effort was not valid
     To hinder him from growing still more pallid.
     'Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?
       The spirit of these walls?'—'In truth not I.'
     'Why Fame—but Fame you know 's sometimes a liar—
       Tells an odd story, of which by and by:
     Whether with time the spectre has grown shyer,
       Or that our sires had a more gifted eye
     For such sights, though the tale is half believed,
     The friar of late has not been oft perceived.
     "The last time was——"—"I pray," said Adeline—
       (Who watch'd the changes of Don Juan's brow,
     And from its context thought she could divine
       Connexions stronger then he chose to avow
     With this same legend)—'if you but design
       To jest, you 'll choose some other theme just now,
     Because the present tale has oft been told,
     And is not much improved by growing old.'
     'Jest!' quoth Milor; 'why, Adeline, you know
       That we ourselves—'t was in the honey-moon—
     Saw——"—"Well, no matter, 'twas so long ago;
       But, come, I 'll set your story to a tune.'
     Graceful as Dian, when she draws her bow,
       She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon
     As touch'd, and plaintively began to play
     The air of ''T was a Friar of Orders Gray.'
     'But add the words,' cried Henry, 'which you made;
       For Adeline is half a poetess,'
     Turning round to the rest, he smiling said.
       Of course the others could not but express
     In courtesy their wish to see display'd
       By one three talents, for there were no less—
     The voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once
     Could hardly be united by a dunce.
     After some fascinating hesitation,—
       The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,
     I can't tell why, to this dissimulation,—
       Fair Adeline, with eyes fix'd on the ground
     At first, then kindling into animation,
       Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,
     And sang with much simplicity,—a merit
     Not the less precious, that we seldom hear it.
          Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
            Who sitteth by Norman stone,
          For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,
            And his mass of the days that are gone.
          When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,
            Made Norman Church his prey,
          And expell'd the friars, one friar still
            Would not be driven away.
          Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,
            To turn church lands to lay,
          With sword in hand, and torch to light
            Their walls, if they said nay;
          A monk remain'd, unchased, unchain'd,
            And he did not seem form'd of clay,
          For he 's seen in the porch, and he 's seen in the church,
            Though he is not seen by day.
          And whether for good, or whether for ill,
            It is not mine to say;
          But still with the house of Amundeville
            He abideth night and day.
          By the marriage-bed of their lords, 't is said,
            He flits on the bridal eve;
          And 't is held as faith, to their bed of death
            He comes—but not to grieve.
          When an heir is born, he 's heard to mourn,
            And when aught is to befall
          That ancient line, in the "we moonshine
            He walks from hall to hall.
          His form you may trace, but not his face,
            'T is shadow'd by his cowl;
          But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,
            And they seem of a parted soul.
          But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
            He still retains his sway,
          For he is yet the church's heir
            Whoever may be the lay.
          Amundeville is lord by day,
            But the monk is lord by night;
          Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal
            To question that friar's right.
          Say nought to him as he walks the hall,
            And he 'll say nought to you;
          He sweeps along in his dusky pall,
            As o'er the grass the dew.
          Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;
            Heaven sain him, fair or foul!
          And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,
            Let ours be for his soul.
     The lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires
       Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;
     And the pause follow'd, which when song expires
       Pervades a moment those who listen round;
     And then of course the circle much admires,
       Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,
     The tones, the feeling, and the execution,
     To the performer's diffident confusion.
     Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,
       As if she rated such accomplishment
     As the mere pastime of an idle day,
       Pursued an instant for her own content,
     Would now and then as 't were without display,
       Yet with display in fact, at times relent
     To such performances with haughty smile,
     To show she could, if it were worth her while.
     Now this (but we will whisper it aside)
       Was—pardon the pedantic illustration—
     Trampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,
       As did the Cynic on some like occasion;
     Deeming the sage would be much mortified,
       Or thrown into a philosophic passion,
     For a spoil'd carpet—but the 'Attic Bee'
     Was much consoled by his own repartee.
     Thus Adeline would throw into the shade
       (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,
     What dilettanti do with vast parade)
       Their sort of half profession; for it grows
     To something like this when too oft display'd;
       And that it is so everybody knows
     Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,
     Show off—to please their company or mother.
     O! the long evenings of duets and trios!
       The admirations and the speculations;
     The 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!'
       The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:
     The 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!'
       Amongst our own most musical of nations;
     With 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale,
     To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.
     In Babylon's bravuras—as the home
       Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,
     That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam
       O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,
     The calentures of music which o'ercome
       All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,
     No more to be beheld but in such visions—
     Was Adeline well versed, as compositions.
     She also had a twilight tinge of 'Blue,'
       Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,
     Made epigrams occasionally too
       Upon her friends, as everybody ought.
     But still from that sublimer azure hue,
       So much the present dye, she was remote;
     Was weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,
     And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.
     Aurora—since we are touching upon taste,
       Which now-a-days is the thermometer
     By whose degrees all characters are class'd—
       Was more Shakspearian, if I do not err.
     The worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste
       Had more of her existence, for in her
     There was a depth of feeling to embrace
     Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.
     Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,
       The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,
     If she had any, was upon her face,
       And that was of a fascinating kind.
     A little turn for mischief you might trace
       Also thereon,—but that 's not much; we find
     Few females without some such gentle leaven,
     For fear we should suppose us quite in heaven.
     I have not heard she was at all poetic,
       Though once she was seen reading the 'Bath Guide,'
     And 'Hayley's Triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,
       Because she said her temper had been tried
     So much, the bard had really been prophetic
       Of what she had gone through with—since a bride.
     But of all verse, what most ensured her praise
     Were sonnets to herself, or 'bouts rimes.'
     'T were difficult to say what was the object
       Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay
     To bear on what appear'd to her the subject
       Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.
     Perhaps she merely had the simple project
       To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;
     Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,
     Though why I cannot say—at least this minute.
     But so far the immediate effect
       Was to restore him to his self-propriety,
     A thing quite necessary to the elect,
       Who wish to take the tone of their society:
     In which you cannot be too circumspect,
       Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,
     But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,
     On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.
     And therefore Juan now began to rally
       His spirits, and without more explanation
     To jest upon such themes in many a sally.
       Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,
     With various similar remarks to tally,
       But wish'd for a still more detail'd narration
     Of this same mystic friar's curious doings,
     About the present family's deaths and wooings.
     Of these few could say more than has been said;
       They pass'd as such things do, for superstition
     With some, while others, who had more in dread
       The theme, half credited the strange tradition;
     And much was talk'd on all sides on that head:
       But Juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,
     Which some supposed (though he had not avow'd it)
     Had stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it.
     And then, the mid-day having worn to one,
       The company prepared to separate;
     Some to their several pastimes, or to none,
       Some wondering 't was so early, some so late.
     There was a goodly match too, to be run
       Between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,
     And a young race-horse of old pedigree
     Match'd for the spring, whom several went to see.
     There was a picture-dealer who had brought
       A special Titian, warranted original,
     So precious that it was not to be bought,
       Though princes the possessor were besieging all.
     The king himself had cheapen'd it, but thought
       The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all
     His subjects by his gracious acceptation)
     Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.
     But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,—
       The friend of artists, if not arts,—the owner,
     With motives the most classical and pure,
       So that he would have been the very donor,
     Rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,
       So much he deem'd his patronage an honour,
     Had brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,
     But for his judgment—never known to fail.
     There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic
       Bricklayer of Babel, call'd an architect,
     Brought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,
       Might have from time acquired some slight defect;
     Who after rummaging the Abbey through thick
       And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect
     New buildings of correctest conformation,
     And throw down old—which he call'd restoration.
     The cost would be a trifle—an 'old song,'
       Set to some thousands ('t is the usual burden
     Of that same tune, when people hum it long)—
       The price would speedily repay its worth in
     An edifice no less sublime than strong,
       By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in
     Its glory, through all ages shining sunny,
     For Gothic daring shown in English money.
     There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage
       Lord Henry wish'd to raise for a new purchase;
     Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,
       And one on tithes, which sure are Discord's torches,
     Kindling Religion till she throws down her gage,
       'Untying' squires 'to fight against the churches;'
     There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,
     For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.
     There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,
       Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;
     There was a country girl in a close cap
       And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since—
     Since—since—in youth, I had the sad mishap—
       But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):
     That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,
     Presents the problem of a double figure.
     A reel within a bottle is a mystery,
       One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;
     Therefore the present piece of natural history
       I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;
     And merely state, though not for the consistory,
       Lord Henry was a justice, and that Scout
     The constable, beneath a warrant's banner,
     Had bagg'd this poacher upon Nature's manor.
     Now justices of peace must judge all pieces
       Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game
     And morals of the country from caprices
       Of those who have not a license for the same;
     And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,
       Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:
     Preserving partridges and pretty wenches
     Are puzzles to the most precautious benches.
     The present culprit was extremely pale,
       Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red
     By nature, as in higher dames less hale
       'T is white, at least when they just rise from bed.
     Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,
       Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,
     And knew no better in her immorality
     Than to wax white—for blushes are for quality.
     Her black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,
       Had gather'd a large tear into its corner,
     Which the poor thing at times essay'd to dry,
       For she was not a sentimental mourner
     Parading all her sensibility,
       Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,
     But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,
     To be call'd up for her examination.
     Of course these groups were scatter'd here and there,
       Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.
     The lawyers in the study; and in air
       The prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent
     From town, viz., architect and dealer, were
       Both busy (as a general in his tent
     Writing despatches) in their several stations,
     Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.
     But this poor girl was left in the great hall,
       While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,
     Discuss'd (he hated beer yclept the 'small')
       A mighty mug of moral double ale.
     She waited until justice could recall
       Its kind attentions to their proper pale,
     To name a thing in nomenclature rather
     Perplexing for most virgins—a child's father.
     You see here was enough of occupation
       For the Lord Henry, link'd with dogs and horses.
     There was much bustle too, and preparation
       Below stairs on the score of second courses;
     Because, as suits their rank and situation,
       Those who in counties have great land resources
     Have 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,
     Though not exactly what 's call'd 'open house.'
     But once a week or fortnight, uninvited
       (Thus we translate a general invitation),
     All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,
       May drop in without cards, and take their station
     At the full board, and sit alike delighted
       With fashionable wines and conversation;
     And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,
     Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.
     Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,
       Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;
     But county contests cost him rather dearer,
       Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit
     Had English influence in the self-same sphere here;
       His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,
     Was member for the 'other interest' (meaning
     The same self-interest, with a different leaning).
     Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,
       He was all things to all men, and dispensed
     To some civility, to others bounty,
       And promises to all—which last commenced
     To gather to a somewhat large amount, he
       Not calculating how much they condensed;
     But what with keeping some, and breaking others,
     His word had the same value as another's.
     A friend to freedom and freeholders—yet
       No less a friend to government—he held,
     That he exactly the just medium hit
       'Twixt place and patriotism—albeit compell'd,
     Such was his sovereign's pleasure (though unfit,
       He added modestly, when rebels rail'd),
     To hold some sinecures he wish'd abolish'd,
     But that with them all law would be demolish'd.
     He was 'free to confess' (whence comes this phrase?
       Is 't English? No—'t is only parliamentary)
     That innovation's spirit now-a-days
       Had made more progress than for the last century.
     He would not tread a factious path to praise,
       Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;
     As for his place, he could but say this of it,
     That the fatigue was greater than the profit.
     Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life
       Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;
     But could he quit his king in times of strife,
       Which threaten'd the whole country with perdition?
     When demagogues would with a butcher's knife
       Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)
     The Gordian or the Geordi-an knot, whose strings
     Have tied together commons, lords, and kings.
     Sooner 'come lace into the civil list
       And champion him to the utmost'—he would keep it,
     Till duly disappointed or dismiss'd:
       Profit he care not for, let others reap it;
     But should the day come when place ceased to exist,
       The country would have far more cause to weep it:
     For how could it go on? Explain who can!
     He gloried in the name of Englishman.
     He was as independent—ay, much more—
       Than those who were not paid for independence,
     As common soldiers, or a common—shore,
       Have in their several arts or parts ascendance
     O'er the irregulars in lust or gore,
       Who do not give professional attendance.
     Thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager
     To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.
     All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,
       And thought. I say no more—I 've said too much;
     For all of us have either heard or read—
       Off—or upon the hustings—some slight such
     Hints from the independent heart or head
       Of the official candidate. I 'll touch
     No more on this—the dinner-bell hath rung,
     And grace is said; the grace I should have sung—
     But I 'm too late, and therefore must make play.
       'T was a great banquet, such as Albion old
     Was wont to boast—as if a glutton's tray
       Were something very glorious to behold.
     But 't was a public feast and public day,—
       Quite full, right dull, guests hot, and dishes cold,
     Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,
     And every body out of their own sphere.
     The squires familiarly formal, and
       My lords and ladies proudly condescending;
     The very servants puzzling how to hand
       Their plates—without it might be too much bending
     From their high places by the sideboard's stand—
       Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending.
     For any deviation from the graces
     Might cost both man and master too—their places.
     There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,
       Whose hounds ne'er err'd, nor greyhounds deign'd to lurch;
     Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen
       Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search
     Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.
       There were some massy members of the church,
     Takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,
     And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.
     There were some country wags too—and, alas!
       Some exiles from the town, who had been driven
     To gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,
       And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.
     And lo! upon that day it came to pass,
       I sate next that o'erwhelming son of heaven,
     The very powerful parson, Peter Pith,
     The loudest wit I e'er was deafen'd with.
     I knew him in his livelier London days,
       A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;
     And not a joke he cut but earn'd its praise,
       Until preferment, coming at a sure rate
     (O Providence! how wondrous are thy ways!
       Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?),
     Gave him, to lay the devil who looks o'er Lincoln,
     A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.
     His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;
       But both were thrown away amongst the fens;
     For wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.
       No longer ready ears and short-hand pens
     Imbibed the gay bon-mot, or happy hoax:
       The poor priest was reduced to common sense,
     Or to coarse efforts very loud and long,
     To hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng.
     There is a difference, says the song, 'between
       A beggar and a queen,' or was (of late
     The latter worse used of the two we 've seen—
       But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);
     A difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'
       A difference between crockery ware and plate,
     As between English beef and Spartan broth—
     And yet great heroes have been bred by both.
     But of all nature's discrepancies, none
       Upon the whole is greater than the difference
     Beheld between the country and the town,
       Of which the latter merits every preference
     From those who have few resources of their own,
       And only think, or act, or feel, with reference
     To some small plan of interest or ambition—
     Both which are limited to no condition.
     But 'en avant!' The light loves languish o'er
       Long banquets and too many guests, although
     A slight repast makes people love much more,
       Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know
     Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore
       With vivifying Venus, who doth owe
     To these the invention of champagne and truffles:
     Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.
     Dully past o'er the dinner of the day;
       And Juan took his place, he knew not where,
     Confused, in the confusion, and distrait,
       And sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:
     Though knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,
       He seem'd unconscious of all passing there,
     Till some one, with a groan, exprest a wish
     (Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.
     On which, at the third asking of the bans,
       He started; and perceiving smiles around
     Broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,
       And hastily—as nothing can confound
     A wise man more than laughter from a dunce—
       Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,
     And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it
     He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.
     This was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,
       The supplicator being an amateur;
     But others, who were left with scarce a third,
       Were angry—as they well might, to be sure.
     They wonder'd how a young man so absurd
       Lord Henry at his table should endure;
     And this, and his not knowing how much oats
     Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.
     They little knew, or might have sympathised,
       That he the night before had seen a ghost,
     A prologue which but slightly harmonised
       With the substantial company engross'd
     By matter, and so much materialised,
       That one scarce knew at what to marvel most
     Of two things—how (the question rather odd is)
     Such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies.
     But what confused him more than smile or stare
       From all the 'squires and 'squiresses around,
     Who wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,
       Especially as he had been renown'd
     For some vivacity among the fair,
       Even in the country circle's narrow bound
     (For little things upon my lord's estate
     Were good small talk for others still less great)—
     Was, that he caught Aurora's eye on his,
       And something like a smile upon her cheek.
     Now this he really rather took amiss:
       In those who rarely smile, their smiles bespeak
     A strong external motive; and in this
       Smile of Aurora's there was nought to pique
     Or hope, or love, with any of the wiles
     Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.
     'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,
       Indicative of some surprise and pity;
     And Juan grew carnation with vexation,
       Which was not very wise, and still less witty,
     Since he had gain'd at least her observation,
       A most important outwork of the city—
     As Juan should have known, had not his senses
     By last night's ghost been driven from their defences.
     But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,
       Nor seem embarrass'd—quite the contrary;
     Her aspect was as usual, still—not stern—
       And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,
     Yet grew a little pale—with what? concern?
       I know not; but her colour ne'er was high—
     Though sometimes faintly flush'd—and always clear,
     As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.
     But Adeline was occupied by fame
       This day; and watching, witching, condescending
     To the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,
       And dignity with courtesy so blending,
     As all must blend whose part it is to aim
       (Especially as the sixth year is ending)
     At their lord's, son's, or similar connection's
     Safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.
     Though this was most expedient on the whole,
       And usual—Juan, when he cast a glance
     On Adeline while playing her grand role,
       Which she went through as though it were a dance,
     Betraying only now and then her soul
       By a look scarce perceptibly askance
     (Of weariness or scorn), began to feel
     Some doubt how much of Adeline was real;
     So well she acted all and every part
       By turns—with that vivacious versatility,
     Which many people take for want of heart.
       They err—'t is merely what is call'd mobility,
     A thing of temperament and not of art,
       Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;
     And false—though true; for surely they 're sincerest
     Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.
     This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,
       Heroes sometimes, though seldom—sages never;
     But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,
       Little that 's great, but much of what is clever;
     Most orators, but very few financiers,
       Though all Exchequer chancellors endeavour,
     Of late years, to dispense with Cocker's rigours,
     And grow quite figurative with their figures.
     The poets of arithmetic are they
       Who, though they prove not two and two to be
     Five, as they might do in a modest way,
       Have plainly made it out that four are three,
     Judging by what they take, and what they pay.
       The Sinking Fund's unfathomable sea,
     That most unliquidating liquid, leaves
     The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.
     While Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,
       The fair Fitz-Fulke seem'd very much at ease;
     Though too well bred to quiz men to their faces,
       Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize
     The ridicules of people in all places—
       That honey of your fashionable bees—
     And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;
     And this at present was her kind employment.
     However, the day closed, as days must close;
       The evening also waned—and coffee came.
     Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,
       And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,
     Retired: with most unfashionable bows
       Their docile esquires also did the same,
     Delighted with their dinner and their host,
     But with the Lady Adeline the most.
     Some praised her beauty; others her great grace;
       The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity
     Was obvious in each feature of her face,
       Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.
     Yes; she was truly worthy her high place!
       No one could envy her deserved prosperity.
     And then her dress—what beautiful simplicity
     Draperied her form with curious felicity!
     Meanwhile Sweet Adeline deserved their praises,
       By an impartial indemnification
     For all her past exertion and soft phrases,
       In a most edifying conversation,
     Which turn'd upon their late guests' miens and faces,
       And families, even to the last relation;
     Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,
     And truculent distortion of their tresses.
     True, she said little—'t was the rest that broke
       Forth into universal epigram;
     But then 't was to the purpose what she spoke:
       Like Addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,
     Her own but served to set off every joke,
       As music chimes in with a melodrame.
     How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!
     I ask but this of mine, to—not defend.
     There were but two exceptions to this keen
       Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one
     Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;
       And Juan, too, in general behind none
     In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,
       Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:
     In vain he heard the others rail or rally,
     He would not join them in a single sally.
     'T is true he saw Aurora look as though
       She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook
     Its motive for that charity we owe
       But seldom pay the absent, nor would look
     Farther—it might or might not be so.
       But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,
     Observing little in his reverie,
     Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.
     The ghost at least had done him this much good,
       In making him as silent as a ghost,
     If in the circumstances which ensued
       He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.
     And certainly Aurora had renew'd
       In him some feelings he had lately lost,
     Or harden'd; feelings which, perhaps ideal,
     Are so divine, that I must deem them real:—
     The love of higher things and better days;
       The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance
     Of what is call'd the world, and the world's ways;
       The moments when we gather from a glance
     More joy than from all future pride or praise,
       Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance
     The heart in an existence of its own,
     Of which another's bosom is the zone.
     Who would not sigh Ai ai Tan Kuuerheian
       That hath a memory, or that had a heart?
     Alas! her star must fade like that of Dian:
       Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.
     Anacreon only had the soul to tie an
       Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart
     Of Eros: but though thou hast play'd us many tricks,
     Still we respect thee, 'Alma Venus Genetrix!'
     And full of sentiments, sublime as billows
       Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,
     Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows
       Arrived, retired to his; but to despond
     Rather than rest. Instead of poppies, willows
       Waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond
     Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,
     And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.
     The night was as before: he was undrest,
       Saving his night-gown, which is an undress;
     Completely 'sans culotte,' and without vest;
       In short, he hardly could be clothed with less:
     But apprehensive of his spectral guest,
       He sate with feelings awkward to express
     (By those who have not had such visitations),
     Expectant of the ghost's fresh operations.
     And not in vain he listen'd;—Hush! what 's that?
       I see—I see—Ah, no!—'t is not—yet 't is—
     Ye powers! it is the—the—the—Pooh! the cat!
       The devil may take that stealthy pace of his!
     So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,
       Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,
     Gliding the first time to a rendezvous,
     And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.
     Again—what is 't? The wind? No, no—this time
       It is the sable friar as before,
     With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,
       Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.
     Again through shadows of the night sublime,
       When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore
     The starry darkness round her like a girdle
     Spangled with gems—the monk made his blood curdle.
     A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,
       Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,
     Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,
       Sounding like very supernatural water,
     Came over Juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!
       For immaterialism 's a serious matter;
     So that even those whose faith is the most great
     In souls immortal, shun them tete-a-tete.
     Were his eyes open?—Yes! and his mouth too.
       Surprise has this effect—to make one dumb,
     Yet leave the gate which eloquence slips through
       As wide as if a long speech were to come.
     Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,
       Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:
     His eyes were open, and (as was before
     Stated) his mouth. What open'd next?—the door.
     It open'd with a most infernal creak,
       Like that of hell. 'Lasciate ogni speranza
     Voi che entrate!' The hinge seem'd to speak,
       Dreadful as Dante's rhima, or this stanza;
     Or—but all words upon such themes are weak:
       A single shade 's sufficient to entrance
     Hero—for what is substance to a spirit?
     Or how is 't matter trembles to come near it?
     The door flew wide,—not swiftly, but, as fly
       The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight,
     And then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,
       Half letting in long shadows on the light,
     Which still in Juan's candlesticks burned high,
       For he had two, both tolerably bright,
     And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood
     The sable Friar in his solemn hood.
     Between two worlds life hovers like a star,
       'Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge.
     How little do we know that which we are!
       How less what we may be! The eternal surge
     Of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar
       Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,
     Lash'd from the foam of ages; while the graves
     Of empires heave but like some passing waves.
     Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken
       The night before, but being sick of shaking,
     He first inclined to think he had been mistaken,
       And then to be ashamed of such mistaking.
     His own internal ghost began to awaken
       Within him and to quell his corporal quaking,
     Hinting that soul and body on the whole
     Were odds against a disembodied soul.
     And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,
       And he arose, advanced. The shade retreated,
     But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,
       Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,
     Resolved to thrust the mystery carte and tierce,
       At whatsoever risk of being defeated.
     The ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until
     He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.
     Juan put forth one arm. Eternal powers!
       It touched no soul nor body, but the wall,
     On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers
       Checkered with all the tracery of the hall.
     He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers
       When he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal.
     How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity
     Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity.
     But still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,
       And rather variably for stony death.
     Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared;
       The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.
     A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.
       A red lip with two rows of pearls beneath
     Gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud
     The moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.
     And Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust
       His other arm forth. Wonder upon wonder!
     It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,
      Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.
     He found, as people on most trials must,
       That he had made at first a silly blunder
     And that in his confusion he had caught
     Only the wall, instead of what he sought
     The ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul
       As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.
     A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole
       Forth into something much like flesh and blood.
     Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl
       And they revealed, alas, that ere they should,
     In full, voluptuous, but not o'ergrown bulk,
     The phantom of her frolic Grace—Fitz-Fulke!
     [The end of the 1857 edition]
CANTO THE SEVENTEENTH.
     The world is full of orphans: firstly, those
        Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase
     (But many a lonely tree the loftier grows
        Than others crowded in the forest's maze);
     The next are such as are not doomed to lose
        Their tender parents in their budding days,
     But merely their parental tenderness,
     Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.
     The next are 'only children', as they are styled,
        Who grow up children only, since the old saw
     Pronounces that an 'only' 's a spoilt child.
        But not to go too far, I hold it law
     That where their education, harsh or mild,
        'Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,
     The sufferers, be't in heart or intellect,
     Whate'er the cause are orphans in effect.
     But to return unto the stricter rule
       (As far as words make rules), our common notion
     Of orphans paints at once a parish school,
        A half-starved babe, a wreck upon life's ocean,
     A human (what the Italians nickname) 'mule',
        A theme for pity or some worse emotion;
     Yet, if examined, it might be admitted
     The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.
     Too soon they are parents to themselves; for what
        Are tutors, guardians, and so forth, compared
     With Nature's genial genitors, so that
       A child of Chancery, that Star Chamber ward
     (I'll take the likeness I can first come at),
        Is like a duckling by Dame Partlett reared
     And frights, especially if 'tis a daughter,
     The old hen by running headlong to the water.
     There is a commonplace book argument,
       Which glibly glides from every vulgar tongue
     When any dare a new light to present:
       'If you are right, then everybody's wrong.'
     Suppose the converse of this precedent
       So often urged, so loudly and so long:
     'If you are wrong, then everybody's right.'
     Was ever everybody yet so quite?
     Therefore I would solicit free discussion
       Upon all points, no matter what or whose,
     Because as ages upon ages push on,
       The last is apt the former to accuse
     Of pillowing its head on a pincushion,
       Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse.
     What was a paradox becomes a truth or
     A something like it, as bear witness Luther.
     The sacraments have been reduced to two
       And witches unto none, though somewhat late
     Since burning aged women (save a few,
       Not witches, only bitches, who create
     Mischief in families, as some know or knew,
       Should still be singed, but slightly let me state)
     Has been declared an act of inurbanity,
     Malgé  Sir Matthew Hale's great humanity.
     Great Galileo was debarred the sun,
       Because he fixed it, and to stop his talking
     How earth could round the solar orbit run,
       Found his own legs embargoed from mere walking.
     The man was well nigh dead, ere men begun
       To think his skull had not some need of caulking,
     But now it seems he's right, his notion just,
     No doubt a consolation to his dust.
     Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates—but pages
        Might be filled up, as vainly as before,
     With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,
        Who in his lifetime each was deemed a bore.
     The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages;
       This they must bear with and perhaps much more.
     The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he
     Will have a firm post-obit on posterity.
     If such doom waits each intellectual giant,
      We little people in our lesser way
     To life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,
       And so for one will I, as well I may.
     Would that I were less bilious—but oh fie on't!
       Just as I make my mind up everyday
     To be a totus teres stoic, sage,
     The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.
     Temperate I am, yet never had a temper;
       Modest I am, yet with some slight assurance;
     Changeable too, yet somehow idem semper;
      Patient, but not enamoured of endurance;
     Cheerful, but sometimes rather apt to whimper;
       Mild, but at times a sort of Hercules furens;
     So that I almost think that the same skin
     For one without has two or three within.
     Our hero was in canto the sixteenth
       Left in a tender moonlight situation,
     Such as enables man to show his strength
       Moral or physical On this occasion
     Whether his virtue triumphed, or at length
       His vice—for he was of a kindling nation—
     Is more than I shall venture to describe,
     Unless some beauty with a kiss should bribe.
     I leave the thing a problem, like all things.
       The morning came, and breakfast, tea and toast,
     Of which most men partake, but no one sings.
       The company, whose birth, wealth, worth have cost
     My trembling lyre already several strings,
       Assembled with our hostess and mine host.
      The guests dropped in, the last but one, Her Grace,
     The latest, Juan with his virgin face.
     Which best is to encounter, ghost or none,
       'Twere difficult to say, but Juan looked
     As if he had combated with more than one,
       Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked
     The light that through the Gothic windows shone.
       Her Grace too had a sort of air rebuked,
     Seemed pale and shivered, as if she had kept
     A vigil or dreamt rather more than slept.
